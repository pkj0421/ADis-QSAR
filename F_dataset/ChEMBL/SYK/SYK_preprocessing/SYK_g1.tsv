The off-chip incubation mobility-shift kinase assay uses a microfluidic chip to measure the conversion of a fluorescent peptide substrate to a phosphorylated product. The reaction mixture, from a microtiter plate well, is introduced through a capillary sipper onto the chip, where the nonphosphorylated substrate and phosphorylated product are separated by electrophoresis and detected via laser induced fluorescence. The signature of the fluorescence signal over time reveals the extent of the reaction. The phosphorylated product migrates through the chip faster than the non-phosphorylated substrate, and signals from the two forms of the peptide appear as distinct peaks.

The enzyme reaction was conducted at 20 uM ATP with 0.05 uCi [gamma-33P]ATP (2 uCi for 40 ul assay) and 10 uM peptide substrate at final volume of 40 ul in buffer containing 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM MgCl2, 100 uM Na3VO4, 0.1% BSA and 10% DMSO. The enzyme assay was carried out with human full length SYK in the presence or absence of ten compound concentrations. SYK and compound were pre-incubated for 10 minutes. Then, the enzymatic reaction was initiated by addition of ATP and peptide substrate. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. At the end of incubation, the reaction was terminated by transferring 25 ul of the reaction mixture to 100 ul of 10% streptavidin slurry containing 100 mM EDTA. The reaction product was captured on the affinity resin and sequentially washed on a filtration plate (Millipore, MABVNOB50) with 2M NaCl, 2M M NaCl in 1% phosphoric acid and water to remove free radio nucleotide. Then the incorporation of 33P into peptide substrate was quantified on a microplate scintillation counter.
