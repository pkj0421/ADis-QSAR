The off-chip incubation mobility-shift kinase assay uses a microfluidic chip to measure the conversion of a fluorescent peptide substrate to a phosphorylated product. The reaction mixture, from a microtiter plate well, is introduced through a capillary sipper onto the chip, where the nonphosphorylated substrate and phosphorylated product are separated by electrophoresis and detected via laser induced fluorescence. The signature of the fluorescence signal over time reveals the extent of the reaction. The phosphorylated product migrates through the chip faster than the non-phosphorylated substrate, and signals from the two forms of the peptide appear as distinct peaks.

The catalytic activity of the GST-Syk kinase fusion protein was determined using the Kinase Glo Luminescence Kinase test (Promega; V6712). In this homogeneous test the amount of ATP remaining after the kinase reaction is quantified by a luciferin-luciferase reaction using luminescence. The luminescence signal obtained correlates with the amount of ATP still present and thus correlates inversely with the activity of the protein kinase.

The off-chip incubation mobility-shift kinase assay uses a microfluidic chip to measure the conversion of a fluorescent peptide substrate to a phosphorylated product. The reaction mixture, from a microtiter plate well, is introduced through a capillary sipper onto the chip, where the nonphosphorylated substrate and phosphorylated product are separated by electrophoresis and detected via laser induced fluorescence. The signature of the fluorescence signal over time reveals the extent of the reaction. The phosphorylated product migrates through the chip faster than the non-phosphorylated substrate, and signals from the two forms of the peptide appear as distinct peaks.

Final volume of the reaction was 10 uL. Phosphorylation of the peptide was allowed to proceed for 45x at room temperature. To quench the reaction and detect the phosphorylated product, 2 nM of a Europium-anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Perkin Elmer #AD0161) and 70 nM SA-APC (Perkin-Elmer #CR130-100) were added together in 15 mM Tris pH 7.5.

The off-chip incubation mobility-shift kinase assay uses a microfluidic chip to measure the conversion of a fluorescent peptide substrate to a phosphorylated product. The reaction mixture, from a microtiter plate well, is introduced through a capillary sipper onto the chip, where the nonphosphorylated substrate and phosphorylated product are separated by electrophoresis and detected via laser induced fluorescence. The signature of the fluorescence signal over time reveals the extent of the reaction. The phosphorylated product migrates through the chip faster than the non-phosphorylated substrate, and signals from the two forms of the peptide appear as distinct peaks.

The off-chip incubation mobility-shift kinase assay uses a microfluidic chip to measure the conversion of a fluorescent peptide substrate to a phosphorylated product. The reaction mixture, from a microtiter plate well, is introduced through a capillary sipper onto the chip, where the nonphosphorylated substrate and phosphorylated product are separated by electrophoresis and detected via laser induced fluorescence. The signature of the fluorescence signal over time reveals the extent of the reaction. The phosphorylated product migrates through the chip faster than the non-phosphorylated substrate, and signals from the two forms of the peptide appear as distinct peaks.

The off-chip incubation mobility-shift kinase assay uses a microfluidic chip to measure the conversion of a fluorescent peptide substrate to a phosphorylated product. The reaction mixture, from a microtiter plate well, is introduced through a capillary sipper onto the chip, where the nonphosphorylated substrate and phosphorylated product are separated by electrophoresis and detected via laser induced fluorescence. The signature of the fluorescence signal over time reveals the extent of the reaction. The phosphorylated product migrates through the chip faster than the non-phosphorylated substrate, and signals from the two forms of the peptide appear as distinct peaks.

The off-chip incubation mobility-shift kinase assay uses a microfluidic chip to measure the conversion of a fluorescent peptide substrate to a phosphorylated product. The reaction mixture, from a microtiter plate well, is introduced through a capillary sipper onto the chip, where the nonphosphorylated substrate and phosphorylated product are separated by electrophoresis and detected via laser induced fluorescence. The signature of the fluorescence signal over time reveals the extent of the reaction. The phosphorylated product migrates through the chip faster than the non-phosphorylated substrate, and signals from the two forms of the peptide appear as distinct peaks.

The reaction mixture, from a microtiter plate well, is introduced through a capillary sipper onto the chip, where the nonphosphorylated substrate and phosphorylated product are separated by electrophoresis and detected via laser induced fluorescence. The signature of the fluorescence signal over time reveals the extent of the reaction. The phosphorylated product migrates through the chip faster than the non-phosphorylated substrate, and signals from the two forms of the peptide appear as distinct peaks.

The off-chip incubation mobility-shift kinase assay uses a microfluidic chip to measure the conversion of a fluorescent peptide substrate to a phosphorylated product. The reaction mixture, from a microtiter plate well, is introduced through a capillary sipper onto the chip, where the nonphosphorylated substrate and phosphorylated product are separated by electrophoresis and detected via laser induced fluorescence. The signature of the fluorescence signal over time reveals the extent of the reaction. The phosphorylated product migrates through the chip faster than the non-phosphorylated substrate, and signals from the two forms of the peptide appear as distinct peaks.

The phosphorylated product migrates through the chip faster than the non-phosphorylated substrate, and signals from the two forms of the peptide appear as distinct peaks.

The off-chip incubation mobility-shift kinase assay uses a microfluidic chip to measure the conversion of a fluorescent peptide substrate to a phosphorylated product. The reaction mixture, from a microtiter plate well, is introduced through a capillary sipper onto the chip, where the nonphosphorylated substrate and phosphorylated product are separated by electrophoresis and detected via laser induced fluorescence. The signature of the fluorescence signal over time reveals the extent of the reaction. The phosphorylated product migrates through the chip faster than the non-phosphorylated substrate, and signals from the two forms of the peptide appear as distinct peaks.

The off-chip incubation mobility-shift kinase assay uses a microfluidic chip to measure the conversion of a fluorescent peptide substrate to a phosphorylated product. The reaction mixture, from a microtiter plate well, is introduced through a capillary sipper onto the chip, where the nonphosphorylated substrate and phosphorylated product are separated by electrophoresis and detected via laser induced fluorescence. The signature of the fluorescence signal over time reveals the extent of the reaction. The phosphorylated product migrates through the chip faster than the non-phosphorylated substrate, and signals from the two forms of the peptide appear as distinct peaks.

The reaction mixture, from a microtiter plate well, is introduced through a capillary sipper onto the chip, where the nonphosphorylated substrate and phosphorylated product are separated by electrophoresis and detected via laser induced fluorescence. The signature of the fluorescence signal over time reveals the extent of the reaction. The phosphorylated product migrates through the chip faster than the non-phosphorylated substrate, and signals from the two forms of the peptide appear as distinct peaks.

The recombinant human GST-SYK (Carna Biosciences #08-176) (5 μM final concentration) was incubated with various concentrations of the inhibitor diluted in DMSO (0.1% final concentration) for 10 minutes at room temperature in 15 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.01% tween 20, 2 mM DTT in 384 well plate format. To initiate the reaction the biotinylated substrate peptide (250 nM final concentration) that contains the phosphorylation site for Syk was added with magnesium (5 mM final concentration) and ATP (25 μM final concentration). Final volume of the reaction was 10 μL. Phosphorylation of the peptide was allowed to proceed for 45' at room temperature. To quench the reaction and detect the phosphorylated product, 2 nM of a Europium-anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Perkin Elmer #AD0161) and 70 nM SA-APC (Perkin-Elmer #CR130-100) were added together in 15 mM Tris pH 7.5, 40 mM EDTA, 0.01% tween 20.

The off-chip incubation mobility-shift kinase assay uses a microfluidic chip to measure the conversion of a fluorescent peptide substrate to a phosphorylated product. The reaction mixture, from a microtiter plate well, is introduced through a capillary sipper onto the chip, where the nonphosphorylated substrate and phosphorylated product are separated by electrophoresis and detected via laser induced fluorescence. The signature of the fluorescence signal over time reveals the extent of the reaction. The phosphorylated product migrates through the chip faster than the non-phosphorylated substrate, and signals from the two forms of the peptide appear as distinct peaks.

To quench the reaction and detect the phosphorylated product, 2 nM of a Europium-anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Perkin Elmer #AD0161) and 70 nM SA-APC (Perkin-Elmer #CR130-100) were added together in 15 mM Tris pH 7.5.

In this homogeneous test the amount of ATP remaining after the kinase reaction is quantified by a luciferin-luciferase reaction using luminescence. The luminescence signal obtained correlates with the amount of ATP still present and thus correlates inversely with the activity of the protein kinase. Method:The test compounds were dissolved in 100 % DMSO at a concentration of 10 mM and diluted in DMSO to a concentration of 1 mM.

The off-chip incubation mobility-shift kinase assay uses a microfluidic chip to measure the conversion of a fluorescent peptide substrate to a phosphorylated product. The reaction mixture, from a microtiter plate well, is introduced through a capillary sipper onto the chip, where the nonphosphorylated substrate and phosphorylated product are separated by electrophoresis and detected via laser induced fluorescence. The signature of the fluorescence signal over time reveals the extent of the reaction. The phosphorylated product migrates through the chip faster than the non-phosphorylated substrate, and signals from the two forms of the peptide appear as distinct peaks.
