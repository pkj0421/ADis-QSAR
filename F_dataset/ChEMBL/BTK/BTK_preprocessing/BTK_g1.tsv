Measurements were performed in a reaction volume of 50 uL using 96-well assay plates. Kinase enzyme, inhibitor, ATP (at the Km for the kinase), and 1 uM peptide substrate (Biotin-AVLESEEELYSSARQ-NH2) were incubated in a reaction buffer composed of 20 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, MgCl2 (5-25 mM depending on the kinase), MnCl2 (0-10 mM), 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.01% bovine serum albumin, 0.005% Tween-20, and 10% DMSO at pH 7.4 for one hour. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 1.2 equivalents of EDTA (relative to divalent cation) in 25uL of 1x Lance buffer (Perkin-Elmer). Streptavidin-APC (Perkin-Elmer) and Eu-labeled p-Tyr100 antibody (Perkin-Elmer) in 1x Lance buffer were added in a 25 uL volume to give final concentrations of 100 nM and 2.5 nM, respectively, and the mixture was allowed to incubate for one hour.

Compounds to be tested in assay were prepared as 10x concentrations and serial dilution in half-log increments was performed in DMSO so as to generate 10 point curves. To initiate the FRET reaction, compounds prepared as 10x stock in DMSO was added to the plates and the plates were incubated 18-24 h at 14° C. After the incubation the plates were read on a BMG Pherastar Fluorescent plate reader (or equivalent) and used to measure the emission energy from the europium donor fluorophore (620 nm emission) and the FRET (665 nm emission). The negative control well values were averaged to obtain the mean minimum. The positive 'no inhibitor' control wells were averaged to obtain the mean maximum.

The reaction mixture was analyzed on the Caliper LABCHIP 3000 (Caliper, Hopkinton, Mass.) by electrophoretic separation of the fluorescent substrate and phosphorylated product. Inhibition data were calculated by comparison to no enzyme control reactions for 100% inhibition and no inhibitor controls for 0% inhibition. Dose response curves were generated to determine the concentration required inhibiting 50% of kinase activity (IC50).

The assay is based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Europium Cryptate labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and streptavidin labeled fluorophore, XL-665. In an uninhibited kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide substrate (Tk-Biotin) gets phosphorylated at an intermediate tyrosine site which is captured by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody which eventually acts as a FRET donor. The streptavidin labeled XL-665 binds strongly to the Tk-Biotin substrate and act as a FRET acceptor. The resultant FRET signal is measured at 665 nm. A ratio of this specific fluorescence (665 nm) to the background fluorescence (620 nm), conferred by the free antibody, is directly proportional to the kinase activity. Inhibition of the kinase activity by a pharmacological intervention such as a Btk inhibitor of the present disclosure will result into decreased FRET signal.
