Recombinant Btk was pre-incubated with the compounds disclosed herein at room temperature for 1 hour in an assay buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DT, 20 nM SEB, 0.1% BSA, 0.005% tween-20. The reactions were initiated by the addition of ATP (at the concentration of ATP Km) and peptide substrate (Biotin-AVLESEEELYSSARQ-NH2). After incubating at room temperature for 1 h, an equal volume of stop solution containing 50 mM HEPES pH7.0, 800 mM KF, 20 mM EDTA, 0.1% BSA, Eu cryptate-conjugated p-Tyr66 antibody and streptavidin-labeled XL665 was added to stop the reaction. Plates were further incubated at room temperature for 1 hour, and then the TR-FRET signals (ex337 nm, em 620 nm/665 nm) were read on BMG PHERAstar FS instrument. The residual enzyme activity in presence of increasing concentrations of compounds was calculated based on the ratio of fluorescence at 615 nm to that at 665 nm. The IC50 for each compound was derived from fitting the data to the four-parameter logistic equation by Graphpad Prism software.

The assay is based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Europium Cryptate labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and streptavidin labeled fluorophore, XL-665. In an uninhibited kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide substrate (Tk-Biotin) gets phosphorylated at an intermediate tyrosine site which is captured by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody which eventually acts as a FRET donor. The streptavidin labeled XL-665 binds strongly to the Tk-Biotin substrate and act as a FRET acceptor. The resultant FRET signal is measured at 665 nm. A ratio of this specific fluorescence (665 nm) to the background fluorescence (620 nm), conferred by the free antibody, is directly proportional to the kinase activity. Inhibition of the kinase activity by a pharmacological intervention such as a Btk inhibitor of the present disclosure will result into decreased FRET signal.

The assay is based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Europium Cryptate labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and streptavidin labeled fluorophore, XL-665. In an uninhibited kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide substrate (Tk-Biotin) gets phosphorylated at an intermediate tyrosine site which is captured by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody which eventually acts as a FRET donor. The streptavidin labeled XL-665 binds strongly to the Tk-Biotin substrate and act as a FRET acceptor. The resultant FRET signal is measured at 665 nm. A ratio of this specific fluorescence (665 nm) to the background fluorescence (620 nm), conferred by the free antibody, is directly proportional to the kinase activity.

In an uninhibited kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide substrate (Tk-Biotin) gets phosphorylated at an intermediate tyrosine site which is captured by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody which eventually acts as a FRET donor. The streptavidin labeled XL-665 binds strongly to the Tk-Biotin substrate and act as a FRET acceptor. The resultant FRET signal is measured at 665 nm. A ratio of this specific fluorescence (665 nm) to the background fluorescence (620 nm), conferred by the free antibody, is directly proportional to the kinase activity. Inhibition of the kinase activity by a pharmacological intervention such as a Btk inhibitor of the present disclosure will result into decreased FRET signal.

The assay is based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Europium Cryptate labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and streptavidin labeled fluorophore, XL-665. In an uninhibited kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide substrate (Tk-Biotin) gets phosphorylated at an intermediate tyrosine site which is captured by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody which eventually acts as a FRET donor. The streptavidin labeled XL-665 binds strongly to the Tk-Biotin substrate and act as a FRET acceptor. The resultant FRET signal is measured at 665 nm. A ratio of this specific fluorescence (665 nm) to the background fluorescence (620 nm), conferred by the free antibody, is directly proportional to the kinase activity. Inhibition of the kinase activity by a pharmacological intervention such as a Btk inhibitor of the present disclosure will result into decreased FRET signal.

The kinase reactions were started by stepwise addition of 4.5 ul per well of peptide/ATP-solution (4 uM FITC-Ahx-TSELKKVVALYDYMPMNAND-NH2, 164 uM ATP) in kinase buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.02% Tween20, 0.02% BSA, 0.6% DMSO, 10 mM beta-glycerophosphate, and 10 uM sodium orthovanadate, 18 mM MgCl2, 1 mM MnCl2) and 4.5 ul per well of enzyme solution (6.4 nM full-length human recombinant BTK) in kinase buffer. Kinase reactions were incubated at 30° C. for 60 minutes and subsequently terminated by addition of 16 ul per well of stop solution (100 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5% DMSO, 0.1% Caliper coating reagent, 10 mM EDTA, and 0.015% Brij35). Kinase reactions were analyzed on a Caliper LC3000 workstation by separating phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides and kinase activities were calculated from the amounts of newly formed phospho-peptide. Inhibition data were calculated by comparison to control reactions without enzyme (100% inhibition) and without inhibitors (0% inhibition).

The assay is based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Europium Cryptate labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and streptavidin labeled fluorophore, XL-665. In an uninhibited kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide substrate (Tk-Biotin) gets phosphorylated at an intermediate tyrosine site which is captured by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody which eventually acts as a FRET donor. The streptavidin labeled XL-665 binds strongly to the Tk-Biotin substrate and act as a FRET acceptor. The resultant FRET signal is measured at 665 nm. A ratio of this specific fluorescence (665 nm) to the background fluorescence (620 nm), conferred by the free antibody, is directly proportional to the kinase activity. Inhibition of the kinase activity by a pharmacological intervention such as a Btk inhibitor of the present disclosure will result into decreased FRET signal.
