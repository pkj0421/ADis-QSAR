The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 60 min. and terminated by adding 45 μL of 35 mM EDTA to each sample. The reaction mixture was analyzed on the Caliper LabChip 3000 (Caliper, Hopkinton, Mass.) by electrophoretic separation of the fluorescent substrate and phosphorylated product. Inhibition data were calculated by comparison to no enzyme control reactions for 100% inhibition and vehicle-only reactions for 0% inhibition. The final concentrations of reagents in the assays are ATP, 500 μM; FL-IPTSPITTTYFFFKKK peptide 1.5 μM; IRAK4, 0.6 nM; and DMSO, 1.6%.
