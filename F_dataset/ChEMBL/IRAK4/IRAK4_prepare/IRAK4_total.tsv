The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 60 min. and terminated by adding 45 μL of 35 mM EDTA to each sample. The reaction mixture was analyzed on the Caliper LABCHIP® 3000 (Caliper, Hopkinton, Mass.) by electrophoretic separation of the fluorescent substrate and phosphorylated product. Inhibition data were calculated by comparison to no enzyme control reactions for 100% inhibition and vehicle-only reactions for 0% inhibition. The final concentrations of reagents in the assays are ATP, 500 μM; FL-IPTSPITTTYFFFKKK peptide 1.5 μM; IRAK4, 0.6 nM; and DMSO, 1.6%.

The reaction is initiated by the addition of ATP. After incubation for 30 minutes at 25° C., 60 ul of Progressive IMAP Reagent (Molecular Devices) is added to stop the reaction. Change in RP7030's FP is determined by a FP reader (Analyst HT, LJL BioSystems).

The reaction was initiated by the combination of IRAK4 with substrates and test compounds. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 60 min. and terminated by adding 45 μL of 35 mM EDTA to each sample. The reaction mixture was analyzed on the Caliper LABCHIP® 3000 (Caliper, Hopkinton, Mass.) by electrophoretic separation of the fluorescent substrate and phosphorylated product.
