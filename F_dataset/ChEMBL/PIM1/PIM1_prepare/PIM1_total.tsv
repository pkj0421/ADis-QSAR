Compounds to be tested are dissolved in 100% DMSO and directly distributed into white 384-well plates at 0.5 μl per well. To start the reaction, 10 μl of 5 nM Pim1 kinase and 80 μM BAD peptide (RSRHSSYPAGT-OH) in assay buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT, 0.05% BSA) is added into each well. After 15 minutes, 10 μl of 40 μM ATP in assay buffer is added. Final assay concentrations are 2.5 nM PIM1, 20 μM ATP, 40 μM BAD peptide and 2.5% DMSO. The reaction is performed until approximately 50% of the ATP is depleted, then stopped with the addition of 20 μl KinaseGlo Plus (Promega Corporation) solution. The stopped reaction is incubated for 10 minutes and the remaining ATP detected via luminescence on the Victor2 (Perkin Elmer).

Specific peptide or protein substrates were trans-phosphorylated by their specific ser-thr or tyr kinase in the presence of ATP traced with 33P-gamma-ATP, and in the presence of their own optimal buffer and cofactors.At the end of the phosphorylation reaction, more than 98% unlabeled ATP and radioactive ATP were captured by an excess of the ion exchange dowex resin; the resin then settled down to the bottom of the reaction plate by gravity. Supernatant was subsequently withdrawn and transferred into a counting plate, then evaluated by beta-counting. Kinase Buffer (KB):The buffer for PIM1 assay was composed of HEPES 50 mM, at pH 7.5, with 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 3 uM NaVO3, and 0.2 mg/mL BSA.Â  Full-length human PIM1 was expressed and purified as described in Bullock A N, et al., J.

The phosphorylation of biotinylated-BAD (S112) peptide by full length recombinant Pim-1, Pim-2, or Pim-3 protein was detected with streptavidin:Allophycocyanin (APC) conjugate and a europium (Eu) labeled antibody directed against phosphorylated-BAD (S112). Excitation of Eu by a high energy laser light (337 nm) leads to a transfer of energy to the APC molecule, and results in an emission at 665 nm. The fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of phosphorylated BAD peptide present in the reaction. Compounds were prepared in DMSO by conducting 3-fold serial dilutions to give a 22-point dosing curve having a high dose of 1 μM. A reference compound was included on each assay plate [Costar 3658] in order to validate that plate; on one plate of every assay run, two additional reference compounds were included.

Excitation of Eu by a high energy laser light (337 nm) leads to a transfer of energy to the APC molecule, and results in an emission at 665 nm. The fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of phosphorylated BAD peptide present in the reaction. Compounds were prepared in DMSO by conducting 3-fold serial dilutions to give a 22-point dosing curve having a high dose of 1 μM. A reference compound was included on each assay plate [Costar 3658] in order to validate that plate; on one plate of every assay run, two additional reference compounds were included. The Reaction Buffer consisted of 45 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 15 mM NaCl, and 1 mM MgCl. The quench/detection buffer consisted of 50 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 0.05% BSA, 0.1% Tween and 3 mM EDTA. Biotinylated BAD peptide (Biopeptide), 10 mM ATP (Sigma), Labeled p-BAD (S112) mAb (Cell Signalling and Perkin Elmer) [with 0.05% BSA and 2 mM DTT added] streptavidin:Allophycocyanin [Perkin Elmer]. Final concentrations either Pim-1 enzyme [5 pM], or Pim-2 enzyme [0.5 pM], DMSO [1%], BLC BAD (S112) [0.5 μM], ATP [1.5 μM], streptavidin:Allophycocyanin [0.002 mg/mL] and biotinylated-BAD (S112) mAb [100 pM]. Initial incubations were carried out at RT (22° C.) for 30 min for both Pim-1 and for Pim-2. Pim enzyme is added to compound in buffer, and plates are incubated of 30 min. Biotinylated BAD and ATP are added and plates are incubated for 1 h. A mixture of labeled p-BAD (S112) mAb and quench/detection buffer are added and incubated for 2 h. Fluorescence was measured by an HTRF® Envision microplate reader.

The phosphorylation of biotinylated-BAD (S112) peptide by full length recombinant Pim-1, Pim-2, or Pim-3 protein was detected with streptavidin:Allophycocyanin (APC) conjugate and a europium (Eu) labeled antibody directed against phosphorylated-BAD (S112). Excitation of Eu by a high energy laser light (337 nm) leads to a transfer of energy to the APC molecule, and results in an emission at 665 nm. The fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of phosphorylated BAD peptide present in the reaction. Compounds were prepared in DMSO by conducting 3-fold serial dilutions to give a 22-point dosing curve having a high dose of 1 μM. A reference compound was included on each assay plate [Costar 3658] in order to validate that plate; on one plate of every assay run, two additional reference compounds were included. The Reaction Buffer consisted of 45 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 15 mM NaCl, and 1 mM MgCl. The quench/detection buffer consisted of 50 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 0.05% BSA, 0.1% Tween and 3 mM EDTA. Biotinylated BAD peptide (Biopeptide), 10 mM ATP (Sigma), Labeled p-BAD (S112) mAb (Cell Signalling and Perkin Elmer) [with 0.05% BSA and 2 mM DTT added] streptavidin:Allophycocyanin [Perkin Elmer]. Final concentrations either Pim-1 enzyme [5 pM], or Pim-2 enzyme [0.5 pM], DMSO [1%], BLC BAD (S112) [0.5 μM], ATP [1.5 μM], streptavidin:Allophycocyanin [0.002 mg/mL] and biotinylated-BAD (S112) mAb [100 pM]. Initial incubations were carried out at RT (22° C.) for 30 min for both Pim-1 and for Pim-2. Pim enzyme is added to compound in buffer, and plates are incubated of 30 min. Biotinylated BAD and ATP are added and plates are incubated for 1 h. A mixture of labeled p-BAD (S112) mAb and quench/detection buffer are added and incubated for 2 h. Fluorescence was measured by an HTRF® Envision microplate reader.

Compounds to be tested are dissolved in 100% DMSO and directly distributed into white 384-well plates at 0.5 μl per well. To start the reaction, 10 μl of 5 nM Pim1 kinase and 80 μM BAD peptide (RSRHSSYPAGT-OH) in assay buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT, 0.05% BSA) is added into each well. After 15 minutes, 10 μl of 40 μM ATP in assay buffer is added. Final assay concentrations are 2.5 nM PIM1, 20 μM ATP, 40 μM BAD peptide and 2.5% DMSO. The reaction is performed until approximately 50% of the ATP is depleted, then stopped with the addition of 20 μl KinaseGlo Plus (Promega Corporation) solution. The stopped reaction is incubated for 10 minutes and the remaining ATP detected via luminescence on the Victor2 (Perkin Elmer).

The phosphorylation of biotinylated-BAD (S112) peptide by full length recombinant Pim-1, Pim-2, or Pim-3 protein was detected with streptavidin:Allophycocyanin (APC) conjugate and a europium (Eu) labeled antibody directed against phosphorylated-BAD (S112). Excitation of Eu by a high energy laser light (337 nm) leads to a transfer of energy to the APC molecule, and results in an emission at 665 nm. The fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of phosphorylated BAD peptide present in the reaction. Compounds were prepared in DMSO by conducting 3-fold serial dilutions to give a 10-point dosing curve having a high dose of 1 μM. A reference compound was included on each assay plate in order to validate that plate; on one plate of every assay run, two additional reference compounds were included. The final buffer conditions were as follows: 60 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.05% BSA, 2 mM DTT. Incubations were carried out at RT (22° C.) for 2 h for Pim-1, 1 hour and 30 min for Pim-3, and 45 min for Pim-2.

The phosphorylation of biotinylated-BAD (S112) peptide by full length recombinant Pim-1, Pim-2, or Pim-3 protein was detected with streptavidin:Allophycocyanin (APC) conjugate and a europium (Eu) labeled antibody directed against phosphorylated-BAD (S112). Excitation of Eu by a high energy laser light (337 nm) leads to a transfer of energy to the APC molecule, and results in an emission at 665 nm. The fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of phosphorylated BAD peptide present in the reaction. Compounds were prepared in DMSO by conducting 3-fold serial dilutions to give a 10-point dosing curve having a high dose of 1 μM.

The fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of phosphorylated BAD peptide present in the reaction. Compounds were prepared in DMSO by conducting 3-fold serial dilutions to give a 22-point dosing curve having a high dose of 1 μM. A reference compound was included on each assay plate [Costar 3658] in order to validate that plate; on one plate of every assay run, two additional reference compounds were included. The Reaction Buffer consisted of 45 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 15 mM NaCl, and 1 mM MgCl. The quench/detection buffer consisted of 50 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 0.05% BSA, 0.1% Tween and 3 mM EDTA. Biotinylated BAD peptide (Biopeptide), 10 mM ATP (Sigma), Labeled p-BAD (S112) mAb (Cell Signalling and Perkin Elmer) [with 0.05% BSA and 2 mM DTT added] streptavidin:Allophycocyanin [Perkin Elmer]. Final concentrations either Pim-1 enzyme [5 pM], or Pim-2 enzyme [0.5 pM], DMSO [1%], BLC BAD (S112) [0.5 μM], ATP [1.5 μM], streptavidin:Allophycocyanin [0.002 mg/mL] and biotinylated-BAD (S112) mAb [100 pM]. Initial incubations were carried out at RT (22° C.) for 30 min for both Pim-1 and for Pim-2. Pim enzyme is added to compound in buffer, and plates are incubated of 30 min. Biotinylated BAD and ATP are added and plates are incubated for 1 h. A mixture of labeled p-BAD (S112) mAb and quench/detection buffer are added and incubated for 2 h. Fluorescence was measured by an HTRF® Envision microplate reader.

The phosphorylation of biotinylated-BAD (S112) peptide by full length recombinant Pim-1, Pim-2, or Pim-3 protein was detected with streptavidin:Allophycocyanin (APC) conjugate and a europium (Eu) labeled antibody directed against phosphorylated-BAD (S112). Excitation of Eu by a high energy laser light (337 nm) leads to a transfer of energy to the APC molecule, and results in an emission at 665 nm. The fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of phosphorylated BAD peptide present in the reaction. Compounds were prepared in DMSO by conducting 3-fold serial dilutions to give a 10-point dosing curve having a high dose of 1 μM. A reference compound was included on each assay plate in order to validate that plate; on one plate of every assay run, two additional reference compounds were included. The final buffer conditions were as follows: 60 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.05% BSA, 2 mM DTT. Incubations were carried out at RT (22° C.) for 2 h for Pim-1, 1 hour and 30 min for Pim-3, and 45 min for Pim-2.

The phosphorylation of biotinylated-BAD (S112) peptide by full length recombinant Pim-1, Pim-2, or Pim-3 protein was detected with streptavidin:Allophycocyanin (APC) conjugate and a europium (Eu) labeled antibody directed against phosphorylated-BAD (S112). Excitation of Eu by a high energy laser light (337 nm) leads to a transfer of energy to the APC molecule, and results in an emission at 665 nm. The fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of phosphorylated BAD peptide present in the reaction. Compounds were prepared in DMSO by conducting 3-fold serial dilutions to give a 22-point dosing curve having a high dose of 1 μM. A reference compound was included on each assay plate [Costar 3658] in order to validate that plate; on one plate of every assay run, two additional reference compounds were included. The Reaction Buffer consisted of 45 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 15 mM NaCl, and 1 mM MgCl. The quench/detection buffer consisted of 50 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 0.05% BSA, 0.1% Tween and 3 mM EDTA. Biotinylated BAD peptide (Biopeptide), 10 mM ATP (Sigma), Labeled p-BAD (S112) mAb (Cell Signalling and Perkin Elmer) [with 0.05% BSA and 2 mM DTT added] streptavidin:Allophycocyanin [Perkin Elmer].

Initial incubations were carried out at RT (22° C.) for 30 min for both Pim-1 and for Pim-2. Pim enzyme is added to compound in buffer, and plates are incubated of 30 min. Biotinylated BAD and ATP are added and plates are incubated for 1 h. A mixture of labeled p-BAD (S112) mAb and quench/detection buffer are added and incubated for 2 h.

The phosphorylation of biotinylated-BAD (S112) peptide by full length recombinant Pim-1, Pim-2, or Pim-3 protein was detected with streptavidin:Allophycocyanin (APC) conjugate and a europium (Eu) labeled antibody directed against phosphorylated-BAD (S112). Excitation of Eu by a high energy laser light (337 nm) leads to a transfer of energy to the APC molecule, and results in an emission at 665 nm. The fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of phosphorylated BAD peptide present in the reaction. Compounds were prepared in DMSO by conducting 3-fold serial dilutions to give a 10-point dosing curve having a high dose of 1 μM. A reference compound was included on each assay plate in order to validate that plate; on one plate of every assay run, two additional reference compounds were included. The final buffer conditions were as follows: 60 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.05% BSA, 2 mM DTT. Incubations were carried out at RT (22° C.) for 2 h for Pim-1, 1 hour and 30 min for Pim-3, and 45 min for Pim-2. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 3 mM EDTA, and fluorescence was measured by an HTRF® Rubystar microplate reader.

The phosphorylation of biotinylated-BAD (S112) peptide by full length recombinant Pim-1, Pim-2, or Pim-3 protein was detected with streptavidin:Allophycocyanin (APC) conjugate and a europium (Eu) labeled antibody directed against phosphorylated-BAD (S112). Excitation of Eu by a high energy laser light (337 nm) leads to a transfer of energy to the APC molecule, and results in an emission at 665 nm. The fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of phosphorylated BAD peptide present in the reaction. Compounds were prepared in DMSO by conducting 3-fold serial dilutions to give a 10-point dosing curve having a high dose of 1 μM. A reference compound was included on each assay plate in order to validate that plate; on one plate of every assay run, two additional reference compounds were included. The final buffer conditions were as follows: 60 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.05% BSA, 2 mM DTT. Incubations were carried out at RT (22° C.) for 2 h for Pim-1, 1 hour and 30 min for Pim-3, and 45 min for Pim-2. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 3 mM EDTA, and fluorescence was measured by an HTRF® Rubystar microplate reader.

The phosphorylation of biotinylated-BAD (S112) peptide by full length recombinant Pim-1, Pim-2, or Pim-3 protein was detected with streptavidin:Allophycocyanin (APC) conjugate and a europium (Eu) labeled antibody directed against phosphorylated-BAD (S112). Excitation of Eu by a high energy laser light (337 nm) leads to a transfer of energy to the APC molecule, and results in an emission at 665 nm. The fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of phosphorylated BAD peptide present in the reaction. Compounds were prepared in DMSO by conducting 3-fold serial dilutions to give a 22-point dosing curve having a high dose of 1 μM. A reference compound was included on each assay plate [Costar 3658] in order to validate that plate; on one plate of every assay run, two additional reference compounds were included.

The phosphorylation of biotinylated-BAD (S112) peptide by full length recombinant Pim-1, Pim-2, or Pim-3 protein was detected with streptavidin:Allophycocyanin (APC) conjugate and a europium (Eu) labeled antibody directed against phosphorylated-BAD (S112). Excitation of Eu by a high energy laser light (337 nm) leads to a transfer of energy to the APC molecule, and results in an emission at 665 nm. The fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of phosphorylated BAD peptide present in the reaction. Compounds were prepared in DMSO by conducting 3-fold serial dilutions to give a 22-point dosing curve having a high dose of 1 μM. A reference compound was included on each assay plate [Costar 3658] in order to validate that plate; on one plate of every assay run, two additional reference compounds were included. The Reaction Buffer consisted of 45 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 15 mM NaCl, and 1 mM MgCl. The quench/detection buffer consisted of 50 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 0.05% BSA, 0.1% Tween and 3 mM EDTA. Biotinylated BAD peptide (Biopeptide), 10 mM ATP (Sigma), Labeled p-BAD (S112) mAb (Cell Signalling and Perkin Elmer) [with 0.05% BSA and 2 mM DTT added] streptavidin:Allophycocyanin [Perkin Elmer].

The fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of phosphorylated BAD peptide present in the reaction.Compounds were prepared in DMSO by conducting 3-fold serial dilutions to give a 10-point dosing curve having a high dose of 1 uM.

The fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of phosphorylated BAD peptide present in the reaction. Compounds were prepared in DMSO by conducting 3-fold serial dilutions to give a 10-point dosing curve having a high dose of 1 μM. A reference compound was included on each assay plate in order to validate that plate; on one plate of every assay run, two additional reference compounds were included. The final buffer conditions were as follows: 60 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.05% BSA, 2 mM DTT. Incubations were carried out at RT (22° C.) for 2 h for Pim-1, 1 hour and 30 min for Pim-3, and 45 min for Pim-2. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 3 mM EDTA, and fluorescence was measured by an HTRF® Rubystar microplate reader.

The phosphorylation of biotinylated-BAD (S112) peptide by full length recombinant Pim-1, Pim-2, or Pim-3 protein was detected with streptavidin:Allophycocyanin (APC) conjugate and a europium (Eu) labeled antibody directed against phosphorylated-BAD (S112).

The phosphorylation of biotinylated-BAD (S112) peptide by full length recombinant Pim-1, Pim-2, or Pim-3 protein was detected with streptavidin:Allophycocyanin (APC) conjugate and a europium (Eu) labeled antibody directed against phosphorylated-BAD (S112). Excitation of Eu by a high energy laser light (337 nm) leads to a transfer of energy to the APC molecule, and results in an emission at 665 nm. The fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of phosphorylated BAD peptide present in the reaction. Compounds were prepared in DMSO by conducting 3-fold serial dilutions to give a 10-point dosing curve having a high dose of 1 μM. A reference compound was included on each assay plate in order to validate that plate; on one plate of every assay run, two additional reference compounds were included. The final buffer conditions were as follows: 60 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.05% BSA, 2 mM DTT.

Specific peptide or protein substrates were trans-phosphorylated by their specific ser-thr or tyr kinase in the presence of ATP traced with 33P-gamma-ATP, and in the presence of their own optimal buffer and cofactors.At the end of the phosphorylation reaction, more than 98% unlabeled ATP and radioactive ATP were captured by an excess of the ion exchange dowex resin; the resin then settled down to the bottom of the reaction plate by gravity. Supernatant was subsequently withdrawn and transferred into a counting plate, then evaluated by beta-counting.

The phosphorylation of biotinylated-BAD (S112) peptide by full length recombinant Pim-1, Pim-2, or Pim-3 protein was detected with streptavidin:Allophycocyanin (APC) conjugate and a europium (Eu) labeled antibody directed against phosphorylated-BAD (S112). Excitation of Eu by a high energy laser light (337 nm) leads to a transfer of energy to the APC molecule, and results in an emission at 665 nm. The fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of phosphorylated BAD peptide present in the reaction. Compounds were prepared in DMSO by conducting 3-fold serial dilutions to give a 10-point dosing curve having a high dose of 1 μM. A reference compound was included on each assay plate in order to validate that plate; on one plate of every assay run, two additional reference compounds were included. The final buffer conditions were as follows: 60 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.05% BSA, 2 mM DTT. Incubations were carried out at RT (22° C.) for 2 h for Pim-1, 1 hour and 30 min for Pim-3, and 45 min for Pim-2. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 3 mM EDTA, and fluorescence was measured by an HTRF® Rubystar microplate reader.

The fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of phosphorylated BAD peptide present in the reaction. Compounds were prepared in DMSO by conducting 3-fold serial dilutions to give a 22-point dosing curve having a high dose of 1 μM. A reference compound was included on each assay plate [Costar 3658] in order to validate that plate; on one plate of every assay run, two additional reference compounds were included. The Reaction Buffer consisted of 45 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 15 mM NaCl, and 1 mM MgCl. The quench/detection buffer consisted of 50 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 0.05% BSA, 0.1% Tween and 3 mM EDTA. Biotinylated BAD peptide (Biopeptide), 10 mM ATP (Sigma), Labeled p-BAD (S112) mAb (Cell Signalling and Perkin Elmer) [with 0.05% BSA and 2 mM DTT added] streptavidin:Allophycocyanin [Perkin Elmer].

Final concentrations either Pim-1 enzyme [5 pM], or Pim-2 enzyme [0.5 pM], DMSO [1%], BLC BAD (S112) [0.5 μM], ATP [1.5 μM], streptavidin:Allophycocyanin [0.002 mg/mL] and biotinylated-BAD (S112) mAb [100 pM]. Initial incubations were carried out at RT (22° C.) for 30 min for both Pim-1 and for Pim-2. Pim enzyme is added to compound in buffer, and plates are incubated of 30 min. Biotinylated BAD and ATP are added and plates are incubated for 1 h. A mixture of labeled p-BAD (S112) mAb and quench/detection buffer are added and incubated for 2 h. Fluorescence was measured by an HTRF® Envision microplate reader.

The phosphorylation of biotinylated-BAD (S112) peptide by full length recombinant Pim-1, Pim-2, or Pim-3 protein was detected with streptavidin:Allophycocyanin (APC) conjugate and a europium (Eu) labeled antibody directed against phosphorylated-BAD (S112). Excitation of Eu by a high energy laser light (337 nm) leads to a transfer of energy to the APC molecule, and results in an emission at 665 nm. The fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of phosphorylated BAD peptide present in the reaction. Compounds were prepared in DMSO by conducting 3-fold serial dilutions to give a 22-point dosing curve having a high dose of 1 μM. A reference compound was included on each assay plate [Costar 3658] in order to validate that plate; on one plate of every assay run, two additional reference compounds were included. The Reaction Buffer consisted of 45 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 15 mM NaCl, and 1 mM MgCl. The quench/detection buffer consisted of 50 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 0.05% BSA, 0.1% Tween and 3 mM EDTA. Biotinylated BAD peptide (Biopeptide), 10 mM ATP (Sigma), Labeled p-BAD (S112) mAb (Cell Signalling and Perkin Elmer) [with 0.05% BSA and 2 mM DTT added] streptavidin:Allophycocyanin [Perkin Elmer].
