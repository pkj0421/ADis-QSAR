This solution is incubated at 30 degrees Celsius at 360 rpm for two hours. Following the incubation, 50 ul of Kinase-Glo reagent is added to each well, including all positive and negative control wells, and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes.

The phosphorylation of biotinylated-BAD (S112) peptide by full length recombinant Pim-1, Pim-2, or Pim-3 protein was detected with streptavidin:Allophycocyanin (APC) conjugate and a europium (Eu) labeled antibody directed against phosphorylated-BAD (S112). Excitation of Eu by a high energy laser light (337 nm) leads to a transfer of energy to the APC molecule, and results in an emission at 665 nm. The fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of phosphorylated BAD peptide present in the reaction. Compounds were prepared in DMSO by conducting 3-fold serial dilutions to give a 10-point dosing curve having a high dose of 1 μM. A reference compound was included on each assay plate in order to validate that plate; on one plate of every assay run, two additional reference compounds were included. The final buffer conditions were as follows: 60 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.05% BSA, 2 mM DTT. Incubations were carried out at RT (22° C.) for 2 h for Pim-1, 1 hour and 30 min for Pim-3, and 45 min for Pim-2. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 3 mM EDTA, and fluorescence was measured by an HTRF® Rubystar microplate reader.

The phosphorylation of biotinylated-BAD (S112) peptide by full length recombinant Pim-1, Pim-2, or Pim-3 protein was detected with streptavidin:Allophycocyanin (APC) conjugate and a europium (Eu) labeled antibody directed against phosphorylated-BAD (S112).

The reaction is performed until approximately 50% of the ATP is depleted, then stopped with the addition of 20 μl KinaseGlo Plus (Promega Corporation) solution. The stopped reaction is incubated for 10 minutes and the remaining ATP detected via luminescence on the Victor2 (Perkin Elmer).

The phosphorylation of biotinylated-BAD (S112) peptide by full length recombinant Pim-1, Pim-2, or Pim-3 protein was detected with streptavidin:Allophycocyanin (APC) conjugate and a europium (Eu) labeled antibody directed against phosphorylated-BAD (S112). Excitation of Eu by a high energy laser light (337 nm) leads to a transfer of energy to the APC molecule, and results in an emission at 665 nm. The fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of phosphorylated BAD peptide present in the reaction. Compounds were prepared in DMSO by conducting 3-fold serial dilutions to give a 10-point dosing curve having a high dose of 1 μM. A reference compound was included on each assay plate in order to validate that plate; on one plate of every assay run, two additional reference compounds were included. The final buffer conditions were as follows: 60 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.05% BSA, 2 mM DTT.

Specific peptide or protein substrates were trans-phosphorylated by their specific ser-thr or tyr kinase in the presence of ATP traced with 33P-gamma-ATP, and in the presence of their own optimal buffer and cofactors.At the end of the phosphorylation reaction, more than 98% unlabeled ATP and radioactive ATP were captured by an excess of the ion exchange dowex resin; the resin then settled down to the bottom of the reaction plate by gravity. Supernatant was subsequently withdrawn and transferred into a counting plate, then evaluated by beta-counting. Kinase Buffer (KB):The buffer for PIM1 assay was composed of HEPES 50 mM, at pH 7.5, with 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 3 uM NaVO3, and 0.2 mg/mL BSA.Â  Full-length human PIM1 was expressed and purified as described in Bullock A N, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 2005, 280, 41675-82.

The phosphorylation of biotinylated-BAD (S112) peptide by full length recombinant Pim-1, Pim-2, or Pim-3 protein was detected with streptavidin:Allophycocyanin (APC) conjugate and a europium (Eu) labeled antibody directed against phosphorylated-BAD (S112). Excitation of Eu by a high energy laser light (337 nm) leads to a transfer of energy to the APC molecule, and results in an emission at 665 nm. The fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of phosphorylated BAD peptide present in the reaction. Compounds were prepared in DMSO by conducting 3-fold serial dilutions to give a 10-point dosing curve having a high dose of 1 μM. A reference compound was included on each assay plate in order to validate that plate; on one plate of every assay run, two additional reference compounds were included. The final buffer conditions were as follows: 60 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.05% BSA, 2 mM DTT. Incubations were carried out at RT (22° C.) for 2 h for Pim-1, 1 hour and 30 min for Pim-3, and 45 min for Pim-2. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 3 mM EDTA, and fluorescence was measured by an HTRF® Rubystar microplate reader.

To start the reaction, 5 .mu.l of 100 nM Bad peptide (Biotin-AGAGRSRHSSYPAGT-OH (SEQ ID NO:1)) and ATP (concentrations described below) in assay buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH=7.5, 5 mM MgCl.sub.2, 0.05% BSA, 0.01% Tween-20, 1 mM DTT) is added to each well. This is followed by the addition of 5 .mu.l/well of Pim 1, Pim 2 or Pim 3 kinase in assay buffer (concentrations described below). Final assay concentrations (described below) are in 2.5% DMSO. The reactions are performed for .about.2 hours.

The phosphorylation of biotinylated-BAD (S112) peptide by full length recombinant Pim-1, Pim-2, or Pim-3 protein was detected with streptavidin:Allophycocyanin (APC) conjugate and a europium (Eu) labeled antibody directed against phosphorylated-BAD (S112). Excitation of Eu by a high energy laser light (337 nm) leads to a transfer of energy to the APC molecule, and results in an emission at 665 nm. The fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of phosphorylated BAD peptide present in the reaction. Compounds were prepared in DMSO by conducting 3-fold serial dilutions to give a 22-point dosing curve having a high dose of 1 μM. A reference compound was included on each assay plate [Costar 3658] in order to validate that plate; on one plate of every assay run, two additional reference compounds were included.

Initial incubations were carried out at RT (22° C.) for 30 min for both Pim-1 and for Pim-2. Pim enzyme is added to compound in buffer, and plates are incubated of 30 min. Biotinylated BAD and ATP are added and plates are incubated for 1 h. A mixture of labeled p-BAD (S112) mAb and quench/detection buffer are added and incubated for 2 h.

Specific peptide or protein substrates were trans-phosphorylated by their specific ser-thr or tyr kinase in the presence of ATP traced with 33P-gamma-ATP, and in the presence of their own optimal buffer and cofactors.At the end of the phosphorylation reaction, more than 98% unlabeled ATP and radioactive ATP were captured by an excess of the ion exchange dowex resin; the resin then settled down to the bottom of the reaction plate by gravity. Supernatant was subsequently withdrawn and transferred into a counting plate, then evaluated by beta-counting.
