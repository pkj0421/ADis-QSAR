The phosphorylation of biotinylated-BAD (S112) peptide by full length recombinant Pim-1, Pim-2, or Pim-3 protein was detected with streptavidin:Allophycocyanin (APC) conjugate and a europium (Eu) labeled antibody directed against phosphorylated-BAD (S112). Excitation of Eu by a high energy laser light (337 nm) leads to a transfer of energy to the APC molecule, and results in an emission at 665 nm. The fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of phosphorylated BAD peptide present in the reaction. Compounds were prepared in DMSO by conducting 3-fold serial dilutions to give a 22-point dosing curve having a high dose of 1 μM.

The phosphorylation of biotinylated-BAD (S112) peptide by full length recombinant Pim-1, Pim-2, or Pim-3 protein was detected with streptavidin:Allophycocyanin (APC) conjugate and a europium (Eu) labeled antibody directed against phosphorylated-BAD (S112). Excitation of Eu by a high energy laser light (337 nm) leads to a transfer of energy to the APC molecule, and results in an emission at 665 nm. The fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of phosphorylated BAD peptide present in the reaction. Compounds were prepared in DMSO by conducting 3-fold serial dilutions to give a 22-point dosing curve having a high dose of 1 μM. A reference compound was included on each assay plate [Costar 3658] in order to validate that plate; on one plate of every assay run, two additional reference compounds were included.

The fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of phosphorylated BAD peptide present in the reaction.Compounds were prepared in DMSO by conducting 3-fold serial dilutions to give a 10-point dosing curve having a high dose of 1 uM.

The phosphorylation of biotinylated-BAD (S112) peptide by full length recombinant Pim-1, Pim-2, or Pim-3 protein was detected with streptavidin:Allophycocyanin (APC) conjugate and a europium (Eu) labeled antibody directed against phosphorylated-BAD (S112). Excitation of Eu by a high energy laser light (337 nm) leads to a transfer of energy to the APC molecule, and results in an emission at 665 nm. The fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of phosphorylated BAD peptide present in the reaction. Compounds were prepared in DMSO by conducting 3-fold serial dilutions to give a 22-point dosing curve having a high dose of 1 μM.

Specific peptide or protein substrates were trans-phosphorylated by their specific ser-thr or tyr kinase in the presence of ATP traced with 33P-gamma-ATP, and in the presence of their own optimal buffer and cofactors.At the end of the phosphorylation reaction, more than 98% unlabeled ATP and radioactive ATP were captured by an excess of the ion exchange dowex resin; the resin then settled down to the bottom of the reaction plate by gravity. Supernatant was subsequently withdrawn and transferred into a counting plate, then evaluated by beta-counting. Kinase Buffer (KB):The buffer for PIM1 assay was composed of HEPES 50 mM, at pH 7.5, with 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 3 uM NaVO3, and 0.2 mg/mL BSA.Â  Full-length human PIM1 was expressed and purified as described in Bullock A N, et al., J.

The phosphorylation of biotinylated-BAD (S112) peptide by full length recombinant Pim-1, Pim-2, or Pim-3 protein was detected with streptavidin:Allophycocyanin (APC) conjugate and a europium (Eu) labeled antibody directed against phosphorylated-BAD (S112). Excitation of Eu by a high energy laser light (337 nm) leads to a transfer of energy to the APC molecule, and results in an emission at 665 nm. The fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of phosphorylated BAD peptide present in the reaction. Compounds were prepared in DMSO by conducting 3-fold serial dilutions to give a 22-point dosing curve having a high dose of 1 μM. A reference compound was included on each assay plate [Costar 3658] in order to validate that plate; on one plate of every assay run, two additional reference compounds were included. The Reaction Buffer consisted of 45 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 15 mM NaCl, and 1 mM MgCl. The quench/detection buffer consisted of 50 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 0.05% BSA, 0.1% Tween and 3 mM EDTA.

Specific peptide or protein substrates were trans-phosphorylated by their specific ser-thr or tyr kinase in the presence of ATP traced with 33P-gamma-ATP, and in the presence of their own optimal buffer and cofactors.At the end of the phosphorylation reaction, more than 98% unlabeled ATP and radioactive ATP were captured by an excess of the ion exchange dowex resin; the resin then settled down to the bottom of the reaction plate by gravity. Supernatant was subsequently withdrawn and transferred into a counting plate, then evaluated by beta-counting.

Specific peptide or protein substrates were trans-phosphorylated by their specific ser-thr or tyr kinase in the presence of ATP traced with 33P-gamma-ATP, and in the presence of their own optimal buffer and cofactors.At the end of the phosphorylation reaction, more than 98% unlabeled ATP and radioactive ATP were captured by an excess of the ion exchange dowex resin; the resin then settled down to the bottom of the reaction plate by gravity. Supernatant was subsequently withdrawn and transferred into a counting plate, then evaluated by beta-counting. Kinase Buffer (KB):The buffer for PIM1 assay was composed of HEPES 50 mM, at pH 7.5, with 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 3 uM NaVO3, and 0.2 mg/mL BSA.Â  Full-length human PIM1 was expressed and purified as described in Bullock A N, et al., J.

ATP Km) were used to determine the biochemical activity of the inhibitors. The activity of Pim 1, Pim 2, & Pim 3 is measured using a homogeneous bead based system quantifying the amount of phosphorylated peptide substrate resulting from kinase-catalyzed phosphoryl transfer to a peptide substrate. Compounds to be tested are dissolved in 100% DMSO and directly distributed to a white 384-well plate at 0.25 .mu.l per well. To start the reaction, 5 .mu.l of 100 nM Bad peptide (Biotin-AGAGRSRHSSYPAGT-OH (SEQ ID NO:1)) and ATP (concentrations described below) in assay buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH=7.5, 5 mM MgCl.sub.2, 0.05% BSA, 0.01% Tween-20, 1 mM DTT) is added to each well. This is followed by the addition of 5 .mu.l/well of Pim 1, Pim 2 or Pim 3 kinase in assay buffer (concentrations described below). Final assay concentrations (described below) are in 2.5% DMSO. The reactions are performed for .about.2 hours.

The phosphorylation of biotinylated-BAD (S112) peptide by full length recombinant Pim-1, Pim-2, or Pim-3 protein was detected with streptavidin:Allophycocyanin (APC) conjugate and a europium (Eu) labeled antibody directed against phosphorylated-BAD (S112). Excitation of Eu by a high energy laser light (337 nm) leads to a transfer of energy to the APC molecule, and results in an emission at 665 nm. The fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of phosphorylated BAD peptide present in the reaction. Compounds were prepared in DMSO by conducting 3-fold serial dilutions to give a 22-point dosing curve having a high dose of 1 μM. A reference compound was included on each assay plate [Costar 3658] in order to validate that plate; on one plate of every assay run, two additional reference compounds were included. The Reaction Buffer consisted of 45 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 15 mM NaCl, and 1 mM MgCl. The quench/detection buffer consisted of 50 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 0.05% BSA, 0.1% Tween and 3 mM EDTA. Biotinylated BAD peptide (Biopeptide), 10 mM ATP (Sigma), Labeled p-BAD (S112) mAb (Cell Signalling and Perkin Elmer) [with 0.05% BSA and 2 mM DTT added] streptavidin:Allophycocyanin [Perkin Elmer]. Final concentrations either Pim-1 enzyme [5 pM], or Pim-2 enzyme [0.5 pM], DMSO [1%], BLC BAD (S112) [0.5 μM], ATP [1.5 μM], streptavidin:Allophycocyanin [0.002 mg/mL] and biotinylated-BAD (S112) mAb [100 pM]. Initial incubations were carried out at RT (22° C.) for 30 min for both Pim-1 and for Pim-2. Pim enzyme is added to compound in buffer, and plates are incubated of 30 min. Biotinylated BAD and ATP are added and plates are incubated for 1 h. A mixture of labeled p-BAD (S112) mAb and quench/detection buffer are added and incubated for 2 h.
