In 384 well black plates (Axygen), 8 ul of compound (2% DMSO) was incubated with 8 ul Lck-peptide substrate (0.5 uM, biotin-Ahx-GAEEEIYAAFFA-COOH) and 8 ul of a mixture of ALK (3 nM, Millipore) and ATP (50 uM) in reaction buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4; 10 mM MgCl2; 2 mM MnCl2; 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate; 0.01% BSA and 1 mM DTT (added fresh before assay) for 1 h at room temperature. Reactions were then quenched by the addition of 30 ul quench solution (streptavidin-allophycocyanin and Europium-cryptate PT66 monoclonal antibody in 40 mM Hepes, pH 7.4; 480 mM KF; 66 mM EDTA; 0.01% Tween-20; and 0.1% BSA) at room temperature. Plates were read 1 h after quenching on an Envision Multilaber Reader and IC50 values were calculated using a sigmoidal fit of the concentration/inhibition response curves. These values were converted to apparent Ki values.
