The final curve included 11 concentrations (10-11 to 10-5 M) plus negative control DMSO tested in triplicate.Kinase and ATP concentrations necessary for optimal activity were determined in separate experiments. (Table 2). Briefly, increasing concentrations of kinase were incubated in a fixed concentration of ATP (200 uM) in Kinase Buffer to determine maximal activity at various time points (30-120 min). The concentration of kinase that resulted in maximal activity with the shortest incubation time was then incubated in Kinase Buffer with increasing concentrations of ATP.

The final curve included 11 concentrations (10-11 to 10-5 M) plus negative control DMSO tested in triplicate.Kinase and ATP concentrations necessary for optimal activity were determined in separate experiments. (Table 2). Briefly, increasing concentrations of kinase were incubated in a fixed concentration of ATP (200 uM) in Kinase Buffer to determine maximal activity at various time points (30-120 min). The concentration of kinase that resulted in maximal activity with the shortest incubation time was then incubated in Kinase Buffer with increasing concentrations of ATP.
