Various concentrations of test compound, 2.5 nM TrkA (Invitrogen Corp., histidine-tagged recombinant human TrkA, cytoplasmic domain), and 500 uM ATP were incubated for 25 minutes at ambient temperature in the coated plates while shaking. The assay buffer consisted of 25 mM MOPS pH 7.5, 0.005% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 5 mM MgCl2. The reaction mixture was removed from the plate by washing with PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20.
