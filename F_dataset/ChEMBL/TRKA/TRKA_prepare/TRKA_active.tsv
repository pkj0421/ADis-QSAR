Various concentrations of test compound, 2.5 nM TrkA (Invitrogen Corp., histidine-tagged recombinant human TrkA, cytoplasmic domain), and 500 uM ATP were incubated for 25 minutes at ambient temperature in the coated plates while shaking The assay buffer consisted of 25 mM MOPS pH 7.5, 0.005% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 5 mM MgCl2. The reaction mixture was removed from the plate by washing with PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. The phosphorylated reaction product was detected using 0.2 ug/mL of a phosphotyrosine specific monoclonal antibody (clone PY20) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase in conjunction with the TMB Peroxidase Substrate System (KPL).

(Table 2). Briefly, increasing concentrations of kinase were incubated in a fixed concentration of ATP (200 uM) in Kinase Buffer to determine maximal activity at various time points (30-120 min). The concentration of kinase that resulted in maximal activity with the shortest incubation time was then incubated in Kinase Buffer with increasing concentrations of ATP.

All assay reaction conditions for IC50 determinations were within the linear range with respect to time and enzyme concentration. In a 384 well polypropylene plate, TrkA (0.4 nM, Carna 08-186) was pre-incubated in a 100 mM Hepes-NaOH pH 7.5 buffer containing 0.01% Triton X-100, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1% BSA, 1 mM DTT, 10 uM sodium orthovanadate and 10 uM beta-glycerophosphate and compound with a concentration of 2.5% DMSO for 15 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was initiated with an equal volume of peptide substrate (Caliper Life Sciences catalog no. 760430) and ATP in the aforementioned buffer. The final concentrations in the reaction were 200 pM TrkA, 1.5 uM peptide substrate and 55 uM ATP (ATP Km). The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 180 minutes and terminated with a buffer containing excess EDTA (100 mM Hepes-NaOH pH 7.5, 0.02% Brij.

Various concentrations of test compound, 2.5 nM TrkA (Invitrogen Corp., histidine-tagged recombinant human TrkA, cytoplasmic domain), and 500 uM ATP were incubated for 25 minutes at ambient temperature in the coated plates while shaking. The assay buffer consisted of 25 mM MOPS pH 7.5, 0.005% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 5 mM MgCl2. The reaction mixture was removed from the plate by washing with PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. The phosphorylated reaction product was detected using 0.2 ug/mL of a phosphotyrosine specific monoclonal antibody (clone PY20) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase in conjunction with the TMB Peroxidase Substrate System (KPL).
