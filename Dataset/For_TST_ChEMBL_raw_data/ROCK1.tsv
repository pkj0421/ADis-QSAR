Compounds were tested on three separate days with 8 point dilutions done in duplicate to determine the average IC50 values. The assay conditions were optimized to 15 μl of kinase reaction volume with 5 ng of enzyme in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, and 0.01% Brij-35. The reaction was incubated 1 hr. at room temperature in the presence of 1.5 μM of substrate with 12.5 μM of ATP (ROCK1 assay) or 2 μM of substrate with 50 μM of ATP (ROCK2 assay) in the presence of various concentrations of the compounds. The reaction was then stopped and the ratio of phosphorylated to unphosphorylated peptide substrate was determined by selective cleavage of only the unphosphorylated peptide as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen, cat. PV3793). This was followed by excitation of coumarin at 400 nm resulting in emission at 445 nm and energy transfer to fluorescein and final emission at 520 nm. The substrate contains both coumarin and fluorescein and only uncleaved phosphorylated substrate will undergo FRET."

Compounds were tested on three separate days with 8 point dilutions done in duplicate to determine the average IC50 values. The assay conditions were optimized to 15 μl of kinase reaction volume with 5 ng of enzyme in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, and 0.01% Brij-35. The reaction was incubated 1 hr. at room temperature in the presence of 1.5 μM of substrate with 12.5 μM of ATP (ROCK1 assay) or 2 μM of substrate with 50 μM of ATP (ROCK2 assay) in the presence of various concentrations of the compounds. The reaction was then stopped and the ratio of phosphorylated to unphosphorylated peptide substrate was determined by selective cleavage of only the unphosphorylated peptide as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen, cat. PV3793). This was followed by excitation of coumarin at 400 nm resulting in emission at 445 nm and energy transfer to fluorescein and final emission at 520 nm. The substrate contains both coumarin and fluorescein and only uncleaved phosphorylated substrate will undergo FRET."

Compounds were tested on three separate days with 8 point dilutions done in duplicate to determine the average IC50 values. The assay conditions were optimized to 15 μl of kinase reaction volume with 5 ng of enzyme in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, and 0.01% Brij-35. The reaction was incubated 1 hr. at room temperature in the presence of 1.5 μM of substrate with 12.5 μM of ATP (ROCK1 assay) or 2 μM of substrate with 50 μM of ATP (ROCK2 assay) in the presence of various concentrations of the compounds. The reaction was then stopped and the ratio of phosphorylated to unphosphorylated peptide substrate was determined by selective cleavage of only the unphosphorylated peptide as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen, cat. PV3793). This was followed by excitation of coumarin at 400 nm resulting in emission at 445 nm and energy transfer to fluorescein and final emission at 520 nm.

Compounds were tested on three separate days with 8 point dilutions done in duplicate to determine the average IC50 values. The assay conditions were optimized to 15 μl of kinase reaction volume with 5 ng of enzyme in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, and 0.01% Brij-35. The reaction was incubated 1 hr. at room temperature in the presence of 1.5 μM of substrate with 12.5 μM of ATP (ROCK1 assay) or 2 μM of substrate with 50 μM of ATP (ROCK2 assay) in the presence of various concentrations of the compounds. The reaction was then stopped and the ratio of phosphorylated to unphosphorylated peptide substrate was determined by selective cleavage of only the unphosphorylated peptide as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen, cat. PV3793). This was followed by excitation of coumarin at 400 nm resulting in emission at 445 nm and energy transfer to fluorescein and final emission at 520 nm. The substrate contains both coumarin and fluorescein and only uncleaved phosphorylated substrate will undergo FRET."

Compounds were tested on three separate days with 8 point dilutions done in duplicate to determine the average IC50 values. The assay conditions were optimized to 15 μl of kinase reaction volume with 5 ng of enzyme in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, and 0.01% Brij-35. The reaction was incubated 1 hr. at room temperature in the presence of 1.5 μM of substrate with 12.5 μM of ATP (ROCK1 assay) or 2 μM of substrate with 50 μM of ATP (ROCK2 assay) in the presence of various concentrations of the compounds. The reaction was then stopped and the ratio of phosphorylated to unphosphorylated peptide substrate was determined by selective cleavage of only the unphosphorylated peptide as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen, cat. PV3793). This was followed by excitation of coumarin at 400 nm resulting in emission at 445 nm and energy transfer to fluorescein and final emission at 520 nm. The substrate contains both coumarin and fluorescein and only uncleaved phosphorylated substrate will undergo FRET."

Compounds were tested on three separate days with 8 point dilutions done in duplicate to determine the average IC50 values. The assay conditions were optimized to 15 μl of kinase reaction volume with 5 ng of enzyme in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, and 0.01% Brij-35. The reaction was incubated 1 hr. at room temperature in the presence of 1.5 μM of substrate with 12.5 μM of ATP (ROCK1 assay) or 2 μM of substrate with 50 μM of ATP (ROCK2 assay) in the presence of various concentrations of the compounds. The reaction was then stopped and the ratio of phosphorylated to unphosphorylated peptide substrate was determined by selective cleavage of only the unphosphorylated peptide as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen, cat. PV3793). This was followed by excitation of coumarin at 400 nm resulting in emission at 445 nm and energy transfer to fluorescein and final emission at 520 nm. The substrate contains both coumarin and fluorescein and only uncleaved phosphorylated substrate will undergo FRET."

Compounds were dissolved in DMSO so that the final concentration of DMSO was <2%, and the reaction was initiated with Rho kinase variants. After incubation, the reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA and the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated peptides separated using a LabChip 3000 Reader (Caliper Life Sciences). Controls consisted of assays that did not contain compound, and backgrounds consisted of assays that contained enzyme and substrate but had EDTA from the beginning of the reaction to inhibit kinase activity.

Compounds were tested on three separate days with 8 point dilutions done in duplicate to determine the average IC50 values. The assay conditions were optimized to 15 μl of kinase reaction volume with 5 ng of enzyme in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, and 0.01% Brij-35. The reaction was incubated 1 hr. at room temperature in the presence of 1.5 μM of substrate with 12.5 μM of ATP (ROCK1 assay) or 2 μM of substrate with 50 μM of ATP (ROCK2 assay) in the presence of various concentrations of the compounds. The reaction was then stopped and the ratio of phosphorylated to unphosphorylated peptide substrate was determined by selective cleavage of only the unphosphorylated peptide as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen, cat. PV3793). This was followed by excitation of coumarin at 400 nm resulting in emission at 445 nm and energy transfer to fluorescein and final emission at 520 nm. The substrate contains both coumarin and fluorescein and only uncleaved phosphorylated substrate will undergo FRET."

Compounds were tested on three separate days with 8 point dilutions done in duplicate to determine the average IC50 values. The assay conditions were optimized to 15 μl of kinase reaction volume with 5 ng of enzyme in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, and 0.01% Brij-35. The reaction was incubated 1 hr. at room temperature in the presence of 1.5 μM of substrate with 12.5 μM of ATP (ROCK1 assay) or 2 μM of substrate with 50 μM of ATP (ROCK2 assay) in the presence of various concentrations of the compounds. The reaction was then stopped and the ratio of phosphorylated to unphosphorylated peptide substrate was determined by selective cleavage of only the unphosphorylated peptide as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen, cat. PV3793). This was followed by excitation of coumarin at 400 nm resulting in emission at 445 nm and energy transfer to fluorescein and final emission at 520 nm.

Compounds were tested on three separate days with 8 point dilutions done in duplicate to determine the average IC50 values. The assay conditions were optimized to 15 μl of kinase reaction volume with 5 ng of enzyme in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, and 0.01% Brij-35. The reaction was incubated 1 hr. at room temperature in the presence of 1.5 μM of substrate with 12.5 μM of ATP (ROCK1 assay) or 2 μM of substrate with 50 μM of ATP (ROCK2 assay) in the presence of various concentrations of the compounds. The reaction was then stopped and the ratio of phosphorylated to unphosphorylated peptide substrate was determined by selective cleavage of only the unphosphorylated peptide as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen, cat. PV3793). This was followed by excitation of coumarin at 400 nm resulting in emission at 445 nm and energy transfer to fluorescein and final emission at 520 nm. The substrate contains both coumarin and fluorescein and only uncleaved phosphorylated substrate will undergo FRET."
