A 5 μl of 100× stock of each concentration was added to wells containing 95 μl of 1× reaction buffer (40 mM Tris, pH7.5, mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT and 1 mM CHAPS) to generate 5× stock. Then 2 μl of 5× stock of each concentration was added to a 384 wells-OptiPlate (PerkinElmer, 6007299). For FAK, 4 μl of 2.5 nM FAK, 1 μl of 8 μg/μl BSA and 1.5 μl of 666 nM ULight-poly Glu, Ala, Tyr (1:1:1) peptide substrate, prepared in above reaction buffer, were added to each well. The reaction was initiated by adding 1.5 μl of 33.3 μM ATP. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 120 min before being quenched with 5 μl of 40 mM EDTA stop buffer prepared in 1×LANCE detection buffer (PerkinElmer, CR97-100). For PYK2, 5 μl of 2 nM PYK2 and 1.5 μl of 666 nM ULight-poly Glu, Ala, Tyr (1:1:1) peptide substrate, prepared in above reaction buffer, were added to each well.

A 5 μl of 100× stock of each concentration was added to wells containing 95 μl of 1× reaction buffer (40 mM Tris, pH7.5, mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT and 1 mM CHAPS) to generate 5× stock. Then 2 μl of 5× stock of each concentration was added to a 384 wells-OptiPlate (PerkinElmer, 6007299). For FAK, 4 μl of 2.5 nM FAK, 1 μl of 8 μg/μl BSA and 1.5 μl of 666 nM ULight-poly Glu, Ala, Tyr (1:1:1) peptide substrate, prepared in above reaction buffer, were added to each well. The reaction was initiated by adding 1.5 μl of 33.3 μM ATP. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 120 min before being quenched with 5 μl of 40 mM EDTA stop buffer prepared in 1×LANCE detection buffer (PerkinElmer, CR97-100). For PYK2, 5 μl of 2 nM PYK2 and 1.5 μl of 666 nM ULight-poly Glu, Ala, Tyr (1:1:1) peptide substrate, prepared in above reaction buffer, were added to each well. The reaction was initiated by adding 1.5 μl of 46.6 μM ATP.

The phosphorylated substrate is detected with the europium-labelled phosphotyrosine antibody PY20 (Perkin Elmer, No.: AD0038).In order to determine concentration-activity curves with PTK2-inhibitors the compounds are serially diluted in 10% DMSO/H2O and 10 uL of each dilution are dispensed per well in a 96-well microtitre plate (clear U-shaped base plate, Greiner No. 650101) (the inhibitors are tested in duplicates) and mixed with 10 uL/well of PTK2 kinase (0.01 ug/well). PTK2 kinase is diluted accordingly beforehand with kinase dilution buffer (20 mM TRIS/HCl pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.286 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10% glycerol with the addition of freshly prepared BSA (fraction V 1 mg/mL) and DTT (1 mM))."

The 15 ul assay reactions are run in Greiner brand white 384-well low volume plates. All reactions contained 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 25 mM NaCI, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.01% (v/v) Tween-20, 50 uM Na3V04, 0.01% (w/v) albumin from chicken egg white, 111 nM peptide substrate, 80 pM ATP, and 4 ng/reaction FAK enzyme, with the enzyme being omitted from negative control reactions. Compounds were added in a volume of 100 nl from dilution series made up in DMSO."

The phosphorylated substrate is detected with the europium-labelled phosphotyrosine antibody PY20 (Perkin Elmer, No.: AD0038).In order to determine concentration-activity curves with PTK2-inhibitors the compounds are serially diluted in 10% DMSO/H2O and 10 uL of each dilution are dispensed per well in a 96-well microtitre plate (clear U-shaped base plate, Greiner No. 650101) (the inhibitors are tested in duplicates) and mixed with 10 uL/well of PTK2 kinase (0.01 ug/well). PTK2 kinase is diluted accordingly beforehand with kinase dilution buffer (20 mM TRIS/HCl pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.286 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10% glycerol with the addition of freshly prepared BSA (fraction V 1 mg/mL) and DTT (1 mM))."

A 5 μl of 100× stock of each concentration was added to wells containing 95 μl of 1× reaction buffer (40 mM Tris, pH7.5, mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT and 1 mM CHAPS) to generate 5× stock.

The 15 ul assay reactions are run in Greiner brand white 384-well low volume plates. All reactions contained 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 25 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.01% (v/v) Tween-20, 50 uM Na3V04, 0.01% (w/v) albumin from chicken egg white, 111 nM peptide substrate, 80 uM ATP, and 4 ng/reaction FAK enzyme, with the enzyme being omitted from negative control reactions. Compounds were added in a volume of 100 nl from dilution series made up in DMSO."

For FAK, 4 μl of 2.5 nM FAK, 1 μl of 8 μg/μl BSA and 1.5 μl of 666 nM ULight-poly Glu, Ala, Tyr (1:1:1) peptide substrate, prepared in above reaction buffer, were added to each well. The reaction was initiated by adding 1.5 μl of 33.3 μM ATP. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 120 min before being quenched with 5 μl of 40 mM EDTA stop buffer prepared in 1×LANCE detection buffer (PerkinElmer, CR97-100).

A 5 μl of 100× stock of each concentration was added to wells containing 95 μl of 1× reaction buffer (40 mM Tris, pH7.5, mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT and 1 mM CHAPS) to generate 5× stock.

The phosphorylated substrate is detected with the Europium-labelled phosphotyrosine antibody PY20 (Perkin Elmer, No.: AD0038). In order to determine concentration-activity curves with PTK2-inhibitors the compounds are serially diluted in 10% DMSO/H2O and 10 L of each dilution are dispensed per well in a 96-well microtitre plate (clear U-shaped base plate, Greiner No. 650101) (the inhibitors are tested in duplicates) and mixed with 10 L/well of PTK2 kinase (0.01 ug/well). PTK2 kinase is diluted accordingly beforehand with kinase dilution buffer (20 mM TRIS/HCl pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.286 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10% glycerol with the addition of freshly prepared BSA (fraction V 1 mg/mL) and DTT (1 mM))."

ATP (Sigma #A2383) was adjusted to a final concentration of 10 μM and in 2.5 μL aliquots. The test compound was sequentially diluted at 12 concentrations and treated with an amount of 0.5 μL. After shaking well and allowing to react at room temperature for 60 minutes, 5 μL of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, final concentration 40 mM) diluted in Lance detection buffer (Lance detection buffer) was added and the mixture was left at room temperature for 5 minutes to stop the reaction. After adding 4× Eu-anti-phospho-Tyr (PT66) phosphorylated antibody diluted to a final concentration of 2 nM in detection buffer with an amount of 5 μL, and reaction was performed at room temperature for 60 minutes.

PTK2 kinase is diluted accordingly beforehand with kinase dilution buffer (20 mM TRIS/HCl pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.286 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10% glycerol with the addition of freshly prepared BSA (fraction V 1 mg/mL) and DTT (1 mM))."
