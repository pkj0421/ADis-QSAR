Reaction product is determined quantitatively by fluorescent polarization using progressive IMAP beads from Molecular Devices. The assay reaction may be initiated as follows: 2 μl of the mixture of 1.5 μM FI-Erktide and 75 nM ERK with 2 Î¼l of inhibitor (2 fold serial dilutions for 11 data points for each inhibitor) containing 3% DMSO were added to each well of the plate, followed by the addition of 2 μl of the mixture of 3 nM MEK1 or 12 nM MEK2 and 1200 μM ATP to initiate the reaction (final enzyme concentration was 1 nM for MEK1 or 4 nM for MEK2). The reaction mixture may then be incubated at room temperature for 22 min, and quenched and developed by addition of 20 μl of 1:200 dilution of progressive IMAP beads (Molecular Devices) in 80% buffer A, 20% bufferB and 0.003% Tween 20.

Reaction product is determined quantitatively by fluorescent polarization using progressive IMAP beads from Molecular Devices. The assay reaction may be initiated as follows: 2 μl of the mixture of 1.5 μM FI-Erktide and 75 nM ERK with 2 Î¼l of inhibitor (2 fold serial dilutions for 11 data points for each inhibitor) containing 3% DMSO were added to each well of the plate, followed by the addition of 2 μl of the mixture of 3 nM MEK1 or 12 nM MEK2 and 1200 μM ATP to initiate the reaction (final enzyme concentration was 1 nM for MEK1 or 4 nM for MEK2). The reaction mixture may then be incubated at room temperature for 22 min, and quenched and developed by addition of 20 μl of 1:200 dilution of progressive IMAP beads (Molecular Devices) in 80% buffer A, 20% bufferB and 0.003% Tween 20.

Both proteins and their mutants are expressed and purified under essentially identical conditions. Protein expression is induced with 0.3 mM IPTG at an OD6oo of 0.45-0.7. Expression is then continued for about 12-16 hours at 23-25 C with agitation. Bacterial cells are harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm x 15 min in a Beckman JLA 8.1 rotor, and the pellets resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris HCI pH 7.6, 300 mM NaCI, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 5 % glycerol, Roche Complete protease inhibitor tablets). 20-30 ml lysis buffer are used per liter of E. coli culture.

Reaction product is determined quantitatively by fluorescent polarization using progressive IMAP beads from Molecular Devices. The assay reaction may be initiated as follows: 2 μl of the mixture of 1.5 μM FI-Erktide and 75 nM ERK with 2 Î¼l of inhibitor (2 fold serial dilutions for 11 data points for each inhibitor) containing 3% DMSO were added to each well of the plate, followed by the addition of 2 μl of the mixture of 3 nM MEK1 or 12 nM MEK2 and 1200 μM ATP to initiate the reaction (final enzyme concentration was 1 nM for MEK1 or 4 nM for MEK2). The reaction mixture may then be incubated at room temperature for 22 min, and quenched and developed by addition of 20 μl of 1:200 dilution of progressive IMAP beads (Molecular Devices) in 80% buffer A, 20% bufferB and 0.003% Tween 20.

Reaction product is determined quantitatively by fluorescent polarization using progressive IMAP beads from Molecular Devices. The assay reaction may be initiated as follows: 2 μl of the mixture of 1.5 μM FI-Erktide and 75 nM ERK with 2 Î¼l of inhibitor (2 fold serial dilutions for 11 data points for each inhibitor) containing 3% DMSO were added to each well of the plate, followed by the addition of 2 μl of the mixture of 3 nM MEK1 or 12 nM MEK2 and 1200 μM ATP to initiate the reaction (final enzyme concentration was 1 nM for MEK1 or 4 nM for MEK2). The reaction mixture may then be incubated at room temperature for 22 min, and quenched and developed by addition of 20 μl of 1:200 dilution of progressive IMAP beads (Molecular Devices) in 80% buffer A, 20% bufferB and 0.003% Tween 20.

Reaction product is determined quantitatively by fluorescent polarization using progressive IMAP beads from Molecular Devices. The assay reaction may be initiated as follows: 2 μl of the mixture of 1.5 μM FI-Erktide and 75 nM ERK with 2 Î¼l of inhibitor (2 fold serial dilutions for 11 data points for each inhibitor) containing 3% DMSO were added to each well of the plate, followed by the addition of 2 μl of the mixture of 3 nM MEK1 or 12 nM MEK2 and 1200 μM ATP to initiate the reaction (final enzyme concentration was 1 nM for MEK1 or 4 nM for MEK2). The reaction mixture may then be incubated at room temperature for 22 min, and quenched and developed by addition of 20 μl of 1:200 dilution of progressive IMAP beads (Molecular Devices) in 80% buffer A, 20% bufferB and 0.003% Tween 20. Fluorescence polarization of the resulting reaction mixtures may be measured after a 1 hour incubation at room temperature."

The assay reaction may be initiated as follows: 2 μl of the mixture of 1.5 μM FI-Erktide and 75 nM ERK with 2 Î¼l of inhibitor (2 fold serial dilutions for 11 data points for each inhibitor) containing 3% DMSO were added to each well of the plate, followed by the addition of 2 μl of the mixture of 3 nM MEK1 or 12 nM MEK2 and 1200 μM ATP to initiate the reaction (final enzyme concentration was 1 nM for MEK1 or 4 nM for MEK2). The reaction mixture may then be incubated at room temperature for 22 min, and quenched and developed by addition of 20 μl of 1:200 dilution of progressive IMAP beads (Molecular Devices) in 80% buffer A, 20% bufferB and 0.003% Tween 20.

Expression is then continued for about 12-16 hours at 23-25 C with agitation. Bacterial cells are harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm x 15 min in a Beckman JLA 8.1 rotor, and the pellets resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris HCI pH 7.6, 300 mM NaCI, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 5 % glycerol, Roche Complete protease inhibitor tablets). 20-30 ml lysis buffer are used per liter of E. coli culture.

Reaction product is determined quantitatively by fluorescent polarization using progressive IMAP beads from Molecular Devices. The assay reaction may be initiated as follows: 2 μl of the mixture of 1.5 μM FI-Erktide and 75 nM ERK with 2 Î¼l of inhibitor (2 fold serial dilutions for 11 data points for each inhibitor) containing 3% DMSO were added to each well of the plate, followed by the addition of 2 μl of the mixture of 3 nM MEK1 or 12 nM MEK2 and 1200 μM ATP to initiate the reaction (final enzyme concentration was 1 nM for MEK1 or 4 nM for MEK2). The reaction mixture may then be incubated at room temperature for 22 min, and quenched and developed by addition of 20 μl of 1:200 dilution of progressive IMAP beads (Molecular Devices) in 80% buffer A, 20% bufferB and 0.003% Tween 20.

Reaction product is determined quantitatively by fluorescent polarization using progressive IMAP beads from Molecular Devices. The assay reaction may be initiated as follows: 2 μl of the mixture of 1.5 μM FI-Erktide and 75 nM ERK with 2 Î¼l of inhibitor (2 fold serial dilutions for 11 data points for each inhibitor) containing 3% DMSO were added to each well of the plate, followed by the addition of 2 μl of the mixture of 3 nM MEK1 or 12 nM MEK2 and 1200 μM ATP to initiate the reaction (final enzyme concentration was 1 nM for MEK1 or 4 nM for MEK2). The reaction mixture may then be incubated at room temperature for 22 min, and quenched and developed by addition of 20 μl of 1:200 dilution of progressive IMAP beads (Molecular Devices) in 80% buffer A, 20% bufferB and 0.003% Tween 20.
