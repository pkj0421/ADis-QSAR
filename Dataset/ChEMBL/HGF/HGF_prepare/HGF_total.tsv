IC50 measurements were based on the degree of phosphorylation of poly Glu-Tyr (Sigma-Aldrich, # PO275) that was coated (0.01 mg/per well) on 96-well microplates (R&D systems, # DY990). The reaction was carried out in a 50 μL solution containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MnCl2, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM DTT, 100 μM Na3VO4, 5 μM ATP (Cell Signaling Technology, #9804) and serial dilutions of the test compound. The reaction lasted for 25 minutes at 30° C. After the reaction was completed, the contents of the plates were discarded. Plates were then washed with TBS-T (250 μL/well, 5×) and then blocked with TBS-T containing 1% BSA for 2 hours. The contents of the plates was discarded, and 100 μL (per well) of peroxidase-labeled anti-phospho-tyrosine antibody (Sigma, # A5964) diluted (1:60,000) in 1% BSA containing TBS-T were then added and incubated for 1 hour. Plates were washed with TBS-T (250 μL/well, 5×) and followed by the color reaction using 100 Î¼L (1:1 mixture) of H2O2 and tetramethylbenzidine (R&D Systems, # DY999). The reaction was stopped in minutes with 1004 of 2 N H2SO4. The optical density was measured immediately using a microplate reader at 450 nm with wavelength correction at 540 nm.

This antibody-mediated interaction brings the lanthanide donor and the acceptor into proximity such that resonance energy transfer can take place, resulting in a detectable increase in the FRET signal.The kinase reactions were performed in 384 well microtiter plates in a total reaction volume of 10.05 μL. The assay plates were prepared with 0.05 μL per well of test compound in the appropriate test concentration, as described under preparation of compound dilutions.

An ATP solution (10 mL) was added thereto to proceed with a kinase reaction at room temperature for 30 minutes, and then a 50 mM ethylene diamine acetic acid solution (EDTA, 40 mL) was added to stop the reaction. After that, the reaction mixture was transferred to a plate coated with Streptavidin, followed by culturing under shaking. After 2 hours, the cultured material was washed three times with a PBS-T buffer (PBS 0.05% Tween 20). The europium-labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was diluted to 1:2,500, and 100 mL of the diluent was added per well, followed by culturing under shaking. After 1 hour, the cultured material was washed three times with a PBS-T buffer (PBS 0.05% Tween 20). 100 mL of an enhancement solution was added, followed by shaking culturing for 5 minutes, and then the reaction material was read out within a wavelength range of 615/665 nm using a Wallac Envision 2103 device.

LanthaScreen is the detection of Time-Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) using lanthanide chelates to measure interactions between various binding partners. In a TR-FRET kinase assay, a long-lifetime lanthanide donor species is conjugated to an antibody that specifically binds to a phosphorylated product of a kinase reaction that is labeled with a suitable acceptor fluorophore. This antibody-mediated interaction brings the lanthanide donor and the acceptor into proximity such that resonance energy transfer can take place, resulting in a detectable increase in the FRET signal.The kinase reactions were performed in 384 well microtiter plates in a total reaction volume of 10.05 μL.

LanthaScreen is the detection of Time-Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) using lanthanide chelates to measure interactions between various binding partners. In a TR-FRET kinase assay, a long-lifetime lanthanide donor species is conjugated to an antibody that specifically binds to a phosphorylated product of a kinase reaction that is labeled with a suitable acceptor fluorophore. This antibody-mediated interaction brings the lanthanide donor and the acceptor into proximity such that resonance energy transfer can take place, resulting in a detectable increase in the FRET signal.The kinase reactions were performed in 384 well microtiter plates in a total reaction volume of 10.05 μL. The assay plates were prepared with 0.05 μL per well of test compound in the appropriate test concentration, as described under preparation of compound dilutions.

As substrate for the kinase reaction the peptide KKKSPGEYVNIEFG (JPT, Germany) is used. For the assay, 1 μL of a 51-fold concentrated solution of the test compound in DMSO is pipetted into a white 384-well microtiter plate (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany). 25 μL of a solution of c-Met (final concentration 30 nM) and pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany; final concentration 8 mg/L) in assay buffer [3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS), 50 mM, pH 7; MgCl2, 10 mM; bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.01%; Triton X 100, 0.01%; DTT, 2 mM] are added, and the mixture is incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Then, the kinase reaction is started by the addition of 25 μL of a solution of adenosine triphosphate (ATP, final concentration 30 μM), substrate (final concentration 100 μM), nicotinamide adenine dinucleo-tide (NADH, final concentration 50 μM) and dithiothreitol (DTT, final concentration 2 mM) in assay buffer, and the resulting mixture is incubated for a reaction time of 100 min at 32° C. Subsequently, the amount of phosphorylated substrate is evaluated by measurement of the decrease of NADH fluorescence. Therefore, the fluorescence emissions at 465 nm after excitation at 340 nm is measured in a fluorescence reader, e.g. Tecan Ultra (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland).

LanthaScreen is the detection of Time-Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) using lanthanide chelates to measure interactions between various binding partners. In a TR-FRET kinase assay, a long-lifetime lanthanide donor species is conjugated to an antibody that specifically binds to a phosphorylated product of a kinase reaction that is labeled with a suitable acceptor fluorophore. This antibody-mediated interaction brings the lanthanide donor and the acceptor into proximity such that resonance energy transfer can take place, resulting in a detectable increase in the FRET signal.The kinase reactions were performed in 384 well microtiter plates in a total reaction volume of 10.05 μL. The assay plates were prepared with 0.05 μL per well of test compound in the appropriate test concentration, as described under preparation of compound dilutions.

LanthaScreen is the detection of Time-Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) using lanthanide chelates to measure interactions between various binding partners. In a TR-FRET kinase assay, a long-lifetime lanthanide donor species is conjugated to an antibody that specifically binds to a phosphorylated product of a kinase reaction that is labeled with a suitable acceptor fluorophore. This antibody-mediated interaction brings the lanthanide donor and the acceptor into proximity such that resonance energy transfer can take place, resulting in a detectable increase in the FRET signal.The kinase reactions were performed in 384 well microtiter plates in a total reaction volume of 10.05 μL. The assay plates were prepared with 0.05 μL per well of test compound in the appropriate test concentration, as described under preparation of compound dilutions.

LanthaScreen is the detection of Time-Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) using lanthanide chelates to measure interactions between various binding partners. In a TR-FRET kinase assay, a long-lifetime lanthanide donor species is conjugated to an antibody that specifically binds to a phosphorylated product of a kinase reaction that is labeled with a suitable acceptor fluorophore. This antibody-mediated interaction brings the lanthanide donor and the acceptor into proximity such that resonance energy transfer can take place, resulting in a detectable increase in the FRET signal.The kinase reactions were performed in 384 well microtiter plates in a total reaction volume of 10.05 μL. The assay plates were prepared with 0.05 μL per well of test compound in the appropriate test concentration, as described under preparation of compound dilutions.

IC50 measurements were based on the degree of phosphorylation of poly Glu-Tyr (Sigma-Aldrich, # PO275) that was coated (0.01 mg/per well) on 96-well microplates (R&D systems, # DY990). The reaction was carried out in a 50 μL solution containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MnCl2, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM DTT, 100 μM Na3VO4, 5 μM ATP (Cell Signaling Technology, #9804) and serial dilutions of the test compound. The reaction lasted for 25 minutes at 30° C. After the reaction was completed, the contents of the plates were discarded. Plates were then washed with TBS-T (250 μL/well, 5×) and then blocked with TBS-T containing 1% BSA for 2 hours. The contents of the plates was discarded, and 100 μL (per well) of peroxidase-labeled anti-phospho-tyrosine antibody (Sigma, # A5964) diluted (1:60,000) in 1% BSA containing TBS-T were then added and incubated for 1 hour. Plates were washed with TBS-T (250 μL/well, 5×) and followed by the color reaction using 100 Î¼L (1:1 mixture) of H2O2 and tetramethylbenzidine (R&D Systems, # DY999). The reaction was stopped in minutes with 1004 of 2 N H2SO4. The optical density was measured immediately using a microplate reader at 450 nm with wavelength correction at 540 nm.

LanthaScreen is the detection of Time-Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) using lanthanide chelates to measure interactions between various binding partners. In a TR-FRET kinase assay, a long-lifetime lanthanide donor species is conjugated to an antibody that specifically binds to a phosphorylated product of a kinase reaction that is labeled with a suitable acceptor fluorophore. This antibody-mediated interaction brings the lanthanide donor and the acceptor into proximity such that resonance energy transfer can take place, resulting in a detectable increase in the FRET signal.The kinase reactions were performed in 384 well microtiter plates in a total reaction volume of 10.05 μL. The assay plates were prepared with 0.05 μL per well of test compound in the appropriate test concentration, as described under preparation of compound dilutions.

The reaction lasted for 25 minutes at 30° C. After the reaction was completed, the contents of the plates were discarded. Plates were then washed with TBS-T (250 μL/well, 5×) and then blocked with TBS-T containing 1% BSA for 2 hours. The contents of the plates was discarded, and 100 μL (per well) of peroxidase-labeled anti-phospho-tyrosine antibody (Sigma, # A5964) diluted (1:60,000) in 1% BSA containing TBS-T were then added and incubated for 1 hour. Plates were washed with TBS-T (250 μL/well, 5×) and followed by the color reaction using 100 Î¼L (1:1 mixture) of H2O2 and tetramethylbenzidine (R&D Systems, # DY999). The reaction was stopped in minutes with 1004 of 2 N H2SO4. The optical density was measured immediately using a microplate reader at 450 nm with wavelength correction at 540 nm.

LanthaScreen is the detection of Time-Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) using lanthanide chelates to measure interactions between various binding partners. In a TR-FRET kinase assay, a long-lifetime lanthanide donor species is conjugated to an antibody that specifically binds to a phosphorylated product of a kinase reaction that is labeled with a suitable acceptor fluorophore. This antibody-mediated interaction brings the lanthanide donor and the acceptor into proximity such that resonance energy transfer can take place, resulting in a detectable increase in the FRET signal.The kinase reactions were performed in 384 well microtiter plates in a total reaction volume of 10.05 μL. The assay plates were prepared with 0.05 μL per well of test compound in the appropriate test concentration, as described under preparation of compound dilutions.

The IC50 values for the inhibition of c-Met kinase were determined as described in the literature with some modifications (Wang, X. et al, Mol. Cancer. Ther. 2003, 2(11):1085-1092; Calic, M. et al., Croatica Chemical ACTA. 2005, 78(3):367-374). Briefly, histidine-tagged c-Met catalytic domain fusion protein (Invitrogen, #PV3143) was used for the assay. IC50 measurements were based on the degree of phosphorylation of poly Glu-Tyr (Sigma-Aldrich, #P0275) that was coated (0.01 mg/per well) on 96-well microplates (R&D systems, #DY990). The reaction was carried out in a 50 uL solution containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MnCl2, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM DTT, 100 uM Na3VO4, 5 uM ATP (Cell Signaling Technology, #9804) and serial dilutions of the test compound. The reaction lasted for 25 minutes at 30° C. After the reaction was completed, the contents of the plates were.discarded.

An ATP solution (10 mL) was added thereto to proceed with a kinase reaction at room temperature for 30 minutes, and then a 50 mM ethylene diamine acetic acid solution (EDTA, 40 mL) was added to stop the reaction. After that, the reaction mixture was transferred to a plate coated with Streptavidin, followed by culturing under shaking. After 2 hours, the cultured material was washed three times with a PBS-T buffer (PBS 0.05% Tween 20). The europium-labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was diluted to 1:2,500, and 100 mL of the diluent was added per well, followed by culturing under shaking. After 1 hour, the cultured material was washed three times with a PBS-T buffer (PBS 0.05% Tween 20). 100 mL of an enhancement solution was added, followed by shaking culturing for 5 minutes, and then the reaction material was read out within a wavelength range of 615/665 nm using a Wallac Envision 2103 device.

An ATP solution (10 mL) was added thereto to proceed with a kinase reaction at room temperature for 30 minutes, and then a 50 mM ethylene diamine acetic acid solution (EDTA, 40 mL) was added to stop the reaction. After that, the reaction mixture was transferred to a plate coated with Streptavidin, followed by culturing under shaking. After 2 hours, the cultured material was washed three times with a PBS-T buffer (PBS 0.05% Tween 20). The europium-labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was diluted to 1:2,500, and 100 mL of the diluent was added per well, followed by culturing under shaking. After 1 hour, the cultured material was washed three times with a PBS-T buffer (PBS 0.05% Tween 20). 100 mL of an enhancement solution was added, followed by shaking culturing for 5 minutes, and then the reaction material was read out within a wavelength range of 615/665 nm using a Wallac Envision 2103 device.

This antibody-mediated interaction brings the lanthanide donor and the acceptor into proximity such that resonance energy transfer can take place, resulting in a detectable increase in the FRET signal.The kinase reactions were performed in 384 well microtiter plates in a total reaction volume of 10.05 μL. The assay plates were prepared with 0.05 μL per well of test compound in the appropriate test concentration, as described under preparation of compound dilutions.

This antibody-mediated interaction brings the lanthanide donor and the acceptor into proximity such that resonance energy transfer can take place, resulting in a detectable increase in the FRET signal.The kinase reactions were performed in 384 well microtiter plates in a total reaction volume of 10.05 μL. The assay plates were prepared with 0.05 μL per well of test compound in the appropriate test concentration, as described under preparation of compound dilutions.

An ATP solution (10 mL) was added thereto to proceed with a kinase reaction at room temperature for 30 minutes, and then a 50 mM ethylene diamine acetic acid solution (EDTA, 40 mL) was added to stop the reaction. After that, the reaction mixture was transferred to a plate coated with Streptavidin, followed by culturing under shaking. After 2 hours, the cultured material was washed three times with a PBS-T buffer (PBS 0.05% Tween 20). The europium-labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was diluted to 1:2,500, and 100 mL of the diluent was added per well, followed by culturing under shaking. After 1 hour, the cultured material was washed three times with a PBS-T buffer (PBS 0.05% Tween 20). 100 mL of an enhancement solution was added, followed by shaking culturing for 5 minutes, and then the reaction material was read out within a wavelength range of 615/665 nm using a Wallac Envision 2103 device.

For the assay, 1 μL of a 51-fold concentrated solution of the test compound in DMSO is pipetted into a white 384-well microtiter plate (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany). 25 μL of a solution of c-Met (final concentration 30 nM) and pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany; final concentration 8 mg/L) in assay buffer [3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS), 50 mM, pH 7; MgCl2, 10 mM; bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.01%; Triton X 100, 0.01%; DTT, 2 mM] are added, and the mixture is incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Then, the kinase reaction is started by the addition of 25 μL of a solution of adenosine triphosphate (ATP, final concentration 30 μM), substrate (final concentration 100 μM), nicotinamide adenine dinucleo-tide (NADH, final concentration 50 μM) and dithiothreitol (DTT, final concentration 2 mM) in assay buffer, and the resulting mixture is incubated for a reaction time of 100 min at 32° C. Subsequently, the amount of phosphorylated substrate is evaluated by measurement of the decrease of NADH fluorescence. Therefore, the fluorescence emissions at 465 nm after excitation at 340 nm is measured in a fluorescence reader, e.g. Tecan Ultra (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland).

LanthaScreen is the detection of Time-Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) using lanthanide chelates to measure interactions between various binding partners. In a TR-FRET kinase assay, a long-lifetime lanthanide donor species is conjugated to an antibody that specifically binds to a phosphorylated product of a kinase reaction that is labeled with a suitable acceptor fluorophore. This antibody-mediated interaction brings the lanthanide donor and the acceptor into proximity such that resonance energy transfer can take place, resulting in a detectable increase in the FRET signal.The kinase reactions were performed in 384 well microtiter plates in a total reaction volume of 10.05 μL. The assay plates were prepared with 0.05 μL per well of test compound in the appropriate test concentration, as described under preparation of compound dilutions.

An ATP solution (10 mL) was added thereto to proceed with a kinase reaction at room temperature for 30 minutes, and then a 50 mM ethylene diamine acetic acid solution (EDTA, 40 mL) was added to stop the reaction. After that, the reaction mixture was transferred to a plate coated with Streptavidin, followed by culturing under shaking. After 2 hours, the cultured material was washed three times with a PBS-T buffer (PBS 0.05% Tween 20). The europium-labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was diluted to 1:2,500, and 100 mL of the diluent was added per well, followed by culturing under shaking. After 1 hour, the cultured material was washed three times with a PBS-T buffer (PBS 0.05% Tween 20). 100 mL of an enhancement solution was added, followed by shaking culturing for 5 minutes, and then the reaction material was read out within a wavelength range of 615/665 nm using a Wallac Envision 2103 device.

LanthaScreen is the detection of Time-Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) using lanthanide chelates to measure interactions between various binding partners. In a TR-FRET kinase assay, a long-lifetime lanthanide donor species is conjugated to an antibody that specifically binds to a phosphorylated product of a kinase reaction that is labeled with a suitable acceptor fluorophore. This antibody-mediated interaction brings the lanthanide donor and the acceptor into proximity such that resonance energy transfer can take place, resulting in a detectable increase in the FRET signal.The kinase reactions were performed in 384 well microtiter plates in a total reaction volume of 10.05 μL. The assay plates were prepared with 0.05 μL per well of test compound in the appropriate test concentration, as described under preparation of compound dilutions.

For the assay, 1 μL of a 51-fold concentrated solution of the test compound in DMSO is pipetted into a white 384-well microtiter plate (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany). 25 μL of a solution of c-Met (final concentration 30 nM) and pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany; final concentration 8 mg/L) in assay buffer [3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS), 50 mM, pH 7; MgCl2, 10 mM; bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.01%; Triton X 100, 0.01%; DTT, 2 mM] are added, and the mixture is incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Then, the kinase reaction is started by the addition of 25 μL of a solution of adenosine triphosphate (ATP, final concentration 30 μM), substrate (final concentration 100 μM), nicotinamide adenine dinucleo-tide (NADH, final concentration 50 μM) and dithiothreitol (DTT, final concentration 2 mM) in assay buffer, and the resulting mixture is incubated for a reaction time of 100 min at 32° C. Subsequently, the amount of phosphorylated substrate is evaluated by measurement of the decrease of NADH fluorescence. Therefore, the fluorescence emissions at 465 nm after excitation at 340 nm is measured in a fluorescence reader, e.g. Tecan Ultra (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland).

LanthaScreen is the detection of Time-Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) using lanthanide chelates to measure interactions between various binding partners. In a TR-FRET kinase assay, a long-lifetime lanthanide donor species is conjugated to an antibody that specifically binds to a phosphorylated product of a kinase reaction that is labeled with a suitable acceptor fluorophore. This antibody-mediated interaction brings the lanthanide donor and the acceptor into proximity such that resonance energy transfer can take place, resulting in a detectable increase in the FRET signal.The kinase reactions were performed in 384 well microtiter plates in a total reaction volume of 10.05 μL. The assay plates were prepared with 0.05 μL per well of test compound in the appropriate test concentration, as described under preparation of compound dilutions.

LanthaScreen is the detection of Time-Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) using lanthanide chelates to measure interactions between various binding partners. In a TR-FRET kinase assay, a long-lifetime lanthanide donor species is conjugated to an antibody that specifically binds to a phosphorylated product of a kinase reaction that is labeled with a suitable acceptor fluorophore. This antibody-mediated interaction brings the lanthanide donor and the acceptor into proximity such that resonance energy transfer can take place, resulting in a detectable increase in the FRET signal.The kinase reactions were performed in 384 well microtiter plates in a total reaction volume of 10.05 μL. The assay plates were prepared with 0.05 μL per well of test compound in the appropriate test concentration, as described under preparation of compound dilutions.

LanthaScreen is the detection of Time-Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) using lanthanide chelates to measure interactions between various binding partners. In a TR-FRET kinase assay, a long-lifetime lanthanide donor species is conjugated to an antibody that specifically binds to a phosphorylated product of a kinase reaction that is labeled with a suitable acceptor fluorophore. This antibody-mediated interaction brings the lanthanide donor and the acceptor into proximity such that resonance energy transfer can take place, resulting in a detectable increase in the FRET signal.The kinase reactions were performed in 384 well microtiter plates in a total reaction volume of 10.05 μL.

As substrate for the kinase reaction the peptide KKKSPGEYVNIEFG (JPT, Germany) is used. For the assay, 1 μL of a 51-fold concentrated solution of the test compound in DMSO is pipetted into a white 384-well microtiter plate (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany). 25 μL of a solution of c-Met (final concentration 30 nM) and pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany; final concentration 8 mg/L) in assay buffer [3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS), 50 mM, pH 7; MgCl2, 10 mM; bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.01%; Triton X 100, 0.01%; DTT, 2 mM] are added, and the mixture is incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Then, the kinase reaction is started by the addition of 25 μL of a solution of adenosine triphosphate (ATP, final concentration 30 μM), substrate (final concentration 100 μM), nicotinamide adenine dinucleo-tide (NADH, final concentration 50 μM) and dithiothreitol (DTT, final concentration 2 mM) in assay buffer, and the resulting mixture is incubated for a reaction time of 100 min at 32° C. Subsequently, the amount of phosphorylated substrate is evaluated by measurement of the decrease of NADH fluorescence. Therefore, the fluorescence emissions at 465 nm after excitation at 340 nm is measured in a fluorescence reader, e.g. Tecan Ultra (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland).

LanthaScreen is the detection of Time-Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) using lanthanide chelates to measure interactions between various binding partners. In a TR-FRET kinase assay, a long-lifetime lanthanide donor species is conjugated to an antibody that specifically binds to a phosphorylated product of a kinase reaction that is labeled with a suitable acceptor fluorophore. This antibody-mediated interaction brings the lanthanide donor and the acceptor into proximity such that resonance energy transfer can take place, resulting in a detectable increase in the FRET signal.The kinase reactions were performed in 384 well microtiter plates in a total reaction volume of 10.05 μL. The assay plates were prepared with 0.05 μL per well of test compound in the appropriate test concentration, as described under preparation of compound dilutions.

LanthaScreen is the detection of Time-Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) using lanthanide chelates to measure interactions between various binding partners. In a TR-FRET kinase assay, a long-lifetime lanthanide donor species is conjugated to an antibody that specifically binds to a phosphorylated product of a kinase reaction that is labeled with a suitable acceptor fluorophore. This antibody-mediated interaction brings the lanthanide donor and the acceptor into proximity such that resonance energy transfer can take place, resulting in a detectable increase in the FRET signal.The kinase reactions were performed in 384 well microtiter plates in a total reaction volume of 10.05 μL. The assay plates were prepared with 0.05 μL per well of test compound in the appropriate test concentration, as described under preparation of compound dilutions.

As substrate for the kinase reaction the peptide KKKSPGEYVNIEFG (JPT, Germany) is used. For the assay, 1 μL of a 51-fold concentrated solution of the test compound in DMSO is pipetted into a white 384-well microtiter plate (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany). 25 μL of a solution of c-Met (final concentration 30 nM) and pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany; final concentration 8 mg/L) in assay buffer [3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS), 50 mM, pH 7; MgCl2, 10 mM; bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.01%; Triton X 100, 0.01%; DTT, 2 mM] are added, and the mixture is incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Then, the kinase reaction is started by the addition of 25 μL of a solution of adenosine triphosphate (ATP, final concentration 30 μM), substrate (final concentration 100 μM), nicotinamide adenine dinucleo-tide (NADH, final concentration 50 μM) and dithiothreitol (DTT, final concentration 2 mM) in assay buffer, and the resulting mixture is incubated for a reaction time of 100 min at 32° C. Subsequently, the amount of phosphorylated substrate is evaluated by measurement of the decrease of NADH fluorescence. Therefore, the fluorescence emissions at 465 nm after excitation at 340 nm is measured in a fluorescence reader, e.g. Tecan Ultra (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland).

LanthaScreen is the detection of Time-Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) using lanthanide chelates to measure interactions between various binding partners. In a TR-FRET kinase assay, a long-lifetime lanthanide donor species is conjugated to an antibody that specifically binds to a phosphorylated product of a kinase reaction that is labeled with a suitable acceptor fluorophore. This antibody-mediated interaction brings the lanthanide donor and the acceptor into proximity such that resonance energy transfer can take place, resulting in a detectable increase in the FRET signal.The kinase reactions were performed in 384 well microtiter plates in a total reaction volume of 10.05 μL. The assay plates were prepared with 0.05 μL per well of test compound in the appropriate test concentration, as described under preparation of compound dilutions.

This antibody-mediated interaction brings the lanthanide donor and the acceptor into proximity such that resonance energy transfer can take place, resulting in a detectable increase in the FRET signal.The kinase reactions were performed in 384 well microtiter plates in a total reaction volume of 10.05 μL. The assay plates were prepared with 0.05 μL per well of test compound in the appropriate test concentration, as described under preparation of compound dilutions.

This antibody-mediated interaction brings the lanthanide donor and the acceptor into proximity such that resonance energy transfer can take place, resulting in a detectable increase in the FRET signal.The kinase reactions were performed in 384 well microtiter plates in a total reaction volume of 10.05 μL. The assay plates were prepared with 0.05 μL per well of test compound in the appropriate test concentration, as described under preparation of compound dilutions.

LanthaScreen is the detection of Time-Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) using lanthanide chelates to measure interactions between various binding partners. In a TR-FRET kinase assay, a long-lifetime lanthanide donor species is conjugated to an antibody that specifically binds to a phosphorylated product of a kinase reaction that is labeled with a suitable acceptor fluorophore. This antibody-mediated interaction brings the lanthanide donor and the acceptor into proximity such that resonance energy transfer can take place, resulting in a detectable increase in the FRET signal.The kinase reactions were performed in 384 well microtiter plates in a total reaction volume of 10.05 μL. The assay plates were prepared with 0.05 μL per well of test compound in the appropriate test concentration, as described under preparation of compound dilutions.

LanthaScreen is the detection of Time-Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) using lanthanide chelates to measure interactions between various binding partners. In a TR-FRET kinase assay, a long-lifetime lanthanide donor species is conjugated to an antibody that specifically binds to a phosphorylated product of a kinase reaction that is labeled with a suitable acceptor fluorophore.

LanthaScreen is the detection of Time-Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) using lanthanide chelates to measure interactions between various binding partners. In a TR-FRET kinase assay, a long-lifetime lanthanide donor species is conjugated to an antibody that specifically binds to a phosphorylated product of a kinase reaction that is labeled with a suitable acceptor fluorophore. This antibody-mediated interaction brings the lanthanide donor and the acceptor into proximity such that resonance energy transfer can take place, resulting in a detectable increase in the FRET signal.The kinase reactions were performed in 384 well microtiter plates in a total reaction volume of 10.05 μL. The assay plates were prepared with 0.05 μL per well of test compound in the appropriate test concentration, as described under preparation of compound dilutions.
