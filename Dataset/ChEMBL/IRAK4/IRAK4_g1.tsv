The final assay volume was 30 L prepared from 15 L additions of enzyme and substrates (fluoresceinated peptide and ATP) and test compounds in assay buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.015% Brij 35 and 4 mM DTT). The reaction was initiated by the combination of IRAK4 with substrates and test compounds. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 60 min. and terminated by adding 45 μL of 35 mM EDTA to each sample. The reaction mixture was analyzed on the Caliper LABCHIP® 3000 (Caliper, Hopkinton, Mass.) by electrophoretic separation of the fluorescent substrate and phosphorylated product. Inhibition data were calculated by comparison to no enzyme control reactions for 100% inhibition and vehicle-only reactions for 0% inhibition.
