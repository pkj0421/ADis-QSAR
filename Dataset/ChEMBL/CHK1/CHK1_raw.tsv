The reaction mixture was incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature and stopped by the addition of buffer (125 μL) containing 40 mM EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.1% BSA in TBS (10× concentrate, Sigma). An aliquot (100 μL) of the reaction mix was transferred to a black neutravidin-coated 96-well plate (Perbio) and incubated for 1 hour on a shaker (Titertek, Flow Laboratories) at room temperature. The plates were washed four times with wash buffer (25 mM Tris (pH 8), 150 mM NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20) (WellWash4, Thermo Life Sciences) and incubated for 1 hour as before with antibody mix (100 μL) consisting of anti-phospho CDC25C (diluted 1/4000 equivalent to 0.35 nM-1.25 nM, #9528, Cell Signalling Technology) and europium-labelled anti rabbit IgG, (0.3 μg/mL, AD0105, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) diluted in DELFIA® assay buffer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The plates were washed a further four times with wash buffer before the addition of enhancement solution (100 μL/well, PerkinElmer Life Sciences).

Termination solution: 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.0015% Brij-35, 0.2% Coating Reagent#3, 50 mM EDTA. 2.5-fold kinase solution: The kinase was added to the 1-fold kinase buffer to form a 2.5-fold kinase solution. 2.5-fold substrate solution: FAM fluorescence-labelled polypeptide and ATP were added to the 1-fold kinase buffer to form a 2.5-fold substrate solution. Compounds: The final test concentration of the compound was 10 μM at maximum. Firstly, a 50-fold concentration (i.e. 500 μM) was prepared with 100% DMSO. The compound was diluted with 100% DMSO by 5 folds at 5 concentrations (successively 500 μM, 100 μM, 20 μM, 4 μM, and 0.8 μM). After diluting with 1-fold kinase buffer by 10 folds, 5 μl of the samples were transferred to a 384-well reaction plate. Two negative control wells and two positive control wells were set at each line respectively. Replication was made in a 96-well plate in five concentrations of 5-fold compound. 10% DMSO was added to the positive control well, and 5 μl of EDTA (250 mM) was added to the negative control well. Procedure: To the 384-well reaction plate was added 5-fold compound dissolved in 10% DMSO at 5 μl/well. To the 384-well reaction plate was added 2.5-fold kinase solution at 10 Î¼l/well. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 10 mins. To the 384-well reaction plate was added 2.5-fold substrate solution at 10 μl/well. The plate was incubated at 28° C. for a certain period. 25 μl termination solution was added to terminate the reaction."

The reaction mixture was incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature and stopped by the addition of buffer (125 μL) containing 40 mM EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.1% BSA in TBS (10× concentrate, Sigma). An aliquot (100 μL) of the reaction mix was transferred to a black neutravidin-coated 96-well plate (Perbio) and incubated for 1 hour on a shaker (Titertek, Flow Laboratories) at room temperature.

The plates were washed a further four times with wash buffer before the addition of enhancement solution (100 μL/well, PerkinElmer Life Sciences).
