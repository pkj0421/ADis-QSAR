Recombinant Btk was pre-incubated with the compounds disclosed herein at room temperature for 1 hour in an assay buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DT, 20 nM SEB, 0.1% BSA, 0.005% tween-20. The reactions were initiated by the addition of ATP (at the concentration of ATP Km) and peptide substrate (Biotin-AVLESEEELYSSARQ-NH2). After incubating at room temperature for 1 h, an equal volume of stop solution containing 50 mM HEPES pH7.0, 800 mM KF, 20 mM EDTA, 0.1% BSA, Eu cryptate-conjugated p-Tyr66 antibody and streptavidin-labeled XL665 was added to stop the reaction. Plates were further incubated at room temperature for 1 hour, and then the TR-FRET signals (ex337 nm, em 620 nm/665 nm) were read on BMG PHERAstar FS instrument. The residual enzyme activity in presence of increasing concentrations of compounds was calculated based on the ratio of fluorescence at 615 nm to that at 665 nm. The IC50 for each compound was derived from fitting the data to the four-parameter logistic equation by Graphpad Prism software.

Kinase reactions were analyzed on a Caliper LC3000 workstation by separating phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides and kinase activities were calculated from the amounts of newly formed phospho-peptide. Inhibition data were calculated by comparison to control reactions without enzyme (100% inhibition) and without inhibitors (0% inhibition).

The assay is based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Europium Cryptate labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and streptavidin labeled fluorophore, XL-665. In an uninhibited kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide substrate (Tk-Biotin) gets phosphorylated at an intermediate tyrosine site which is captured by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody which eventually acts as a FRET donor. The streptavidin labeled XL-665 binds strongly to the Tk-Biotin substrate and act as a FRET acceptor. The resultant FRET signal is measured at 665 nm. A ratio of this specific fluorescence (665 nm) to the background fluorescence (620 nm), conferred by the free antibody, is directly proportional to the kinase activity. Inhibition of the kinase activity by a pharmacological intervention such as a Btk inhibitor of the present disclosure will result into decreased FRET signal.

Recombinant Btk was pre-incubated with the compounds disclosed herein at room temperature for 1 hour in an assay buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DT, 20 nM SEB, 0.1% BSA, 0.005% tween-20. The reactions were initiated by the addition of ATP (at the concentration of ATP Km) and peptide substrate (Biotin-AVLESEEELYSSARQ-NH2). After incubating at room temperature for 1 h, an equal volume of stop solution containing 50 mM HEPES pH7.0, 800 mM KF, 20 mM EDTA, 0.1% BSA, Eu cryptate-conjugated p-Tyr66 antibody and streptavidin-labeled XL665 was added to stop the reaction. Plates were further incubated at room temperature for 1 hour, and then the TR-FRET signals (ex337 nm, em 620 nm/665 nm) were read on BMG PHERAstar FS instrument. The residual enzyme activity in presence of increasing concentrations of compounds was calculated based on the ratio of fluorescence at 615 nm to that at 665 nm. The IC50 for each compound was derived from fitting the data to the four-parameter logistic equation by Graphpad Prism software.

The assay is based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Europium Cryptate labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and streptavidin labeled fluorophore, XL-665. In an uninhibited kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide substrate (Tk-Biotin) gets phosphorylated at an intermediate tyrosine site which is captured by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody which eventually acts as a FRET donor. The streptavidin labeled XL-665 binds strongly to the Tk-Biotin substrate and act as a FRET acceptor. The resultant FRET signal is measured at 665 nm. A ratio of this specific fluorescence (665 nm) to the background fluorescence (620 nm), conferred by the free antibody, is directly proportional to the kinase activity.

The assay is based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Europium Cryptate labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and streptavidin labeled fluorophore, XL-665. In an uninhibited kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide substrate (Tk-Biotin) gets phosphorylated at an intermediate tyrosine site which is captured by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody which eventually acts as a FRET donor. The streptavidin labeled XL-665 binds strongly to the Tk-Biotin substrate and act as a FRET acceptor. The resultant FRET signal is measured at 665 nm. A ratio of this specific fluorescence (665 nm) to the background fluorescence (620 nm), conferred by the free antibody, is directly proportional to the kinase activity. Inhibition of the kinase activity by a pharmacological intervention such as a Btk inhibitor of the present disclosure will result into decreased FRET signal.

The reaction was quenched by the addition of 1.2 equivalents of EDTA (relative to divalent cation) in 25 μL of 1× Lance buffer (Perkin-Elmer). Streptavidin-APC (Perkin-Elmer) and Eu-labeled p-Tyr100 antibody (Perkin-Elmer) in 1× Lance buffer were added in a 25 μL volume to give final concentrations of 100 nM and 2.5 nM, respectively, and the mixture was allowed to incubate for one hour. The TR-FRET signal was measured on a multimode plate reader with an excitation wavelength (πEx) of 330 nm and detection wavelengths (πEm) of 615 and 665 nm. Activity was determined by the ratio of the fluorescence at 665 nm to that at 615 nm. For each compound, enzyme activity was measured at various concentrations of compound. Negative control reactions were performed in the absence of inhibitor in replicates of six, and two no-enzyme controls were used to determine baseline fluorescence levels.

The BTK-Eu complex was incubated on ice one hour prior to use at a starting concentration of 50 nM BTK-Bioease: 10 nM Eu-streptavidin (Perkin-Elmer Catalog# AD0062). The assay buffer consisted of 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.15), 0.1 mM DTT, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml BSA with 3% Kinase Stabilizer (Fremont Biosolutions, Catalog #STB-K02). After 1 h, the reaction mixture from above was diluted 10 fold in assay buffer to make 5 nM BTK: 1 nM Eu-Streptavidin complex (donor fluorophore). 18 ul of a mixture of 0.11 nM BTK-Eu and 0.11 nM Kinase Tracer 178 (Invitrogen, Catalog #PV5593,) with BTK-Eu alone as no negative control, was then dispensed into 384-well flat bottom plates (Greiner, 784076). Compounds to be tested in assay were prepared as 10x concentrations and serial dilution in half-log increments was performed in DMSO so as to generate 10 point curves. To initiate the FRET reaction, compounds prepared as 10x stock in DMSO was added to the plates and the plates were incubated 18-24 h at 14° C. After the incubation the plates were read on a BMG Pherastar Fluorescent plate reader (or equivalent) and used to measure the emission energy from the europium donor fluorophore (620 nm emission) and the FRET (665 nm emission). The negative control well values were averaged to obtain the mean minimum. The positive 'no inhibitor' control wells were averaged to obtain the mean maximum.

In an uninhibited kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide substrate (Tk-Biotin) gets phosphorylated at an intermediate tyrosine site which is captured by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody which eventually acts as a FRET donor.

In an uninhibited kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide substrate (Tk-Biotin) gets phosphorylated at an intermediate tyrosine site which is captured by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody which eventually acts as a FRET donor. The streptavidin labeled XL-665 binds strongly to the Tk-Biotin substrate and act as a FRET acceptor. The resultant FRET signal is measured at 665 nm. A ratio of this specific fluorescence (665 nm) to the background fluorescence (620 nm), conferred by the free antibody, is directly proportional to the kinase activity.

The assay is based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Europium Cryptate labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and streptavidin labeled fluorophore, XL-665. In an uninhibited kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide substrate (Tk-Biotin) gets phosphorylated at an intermediate tyrosine site which is captured by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody which eventually acts as a FRET donor. The streptavidin labeled XL-665 binds strongly to the Tk-Biotin substrate and act as a FRET acceptor. The resultant FRET signal is measured at 665 nm. A ratio of this specific fluorescence (665 nm) to the background fluorescence (620 nm), conferred by the free antibody, is directly proportional to the kinase activity. Inhibition of the kinase activity by a pharmacological intervention such as a Btk inhibitor of the present disclosure will result into decreased FRET signal.

Test compounds were diluted to desired concentrations in kinase reaction buffer and briefly incubated with recombinant full-length human BTK kinase with a (His)6 tag (81.3 kDa; Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, Calif.). The assay as described is based on volumes used in a standard 384 well format using solid, white-wall plates. The reaction was subsequently initiated by the addition of ATP and myelin basic protein (MBP) substrate (Millipore Corporation, Waltham, Mass.). Composition of the assay reaction mixture (5 mL volume) was: 5% v/v DMSO, 60 nM BTK, 1.6 uM ATP, and 20 uM MBP substrate. After incubation at room temperature for 60 min, 5 mL of the ADP-Glo reagent (Promega Corporation, Madison, Wis.) was added to each well and incubated for an additional 40 minutes. The reagent stopped the kinase reaction and depleted the unconsumed ATP. Kinase Detection reagent (10 mL; Promega Corporation) was then added to each well. The Kinase Detection reagent comprises reagents to convert ADP to ATP and provide luciferase and luciferin to detect ATP. Luminescence was measured on an EnVision microplate reader (PerkinElmer). The amount of luminescence from each reaction is directly correlated with BTK kinase activity. Percent inhibition and IC50 values were calculated by comparing enzyme activity in drug-treated wells to the appropriate controls.

The assay is based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Europium Cryptate labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and streptavidin labeled fluorophore, XL-665. In an uninhibited kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide substrate (Tk-Biotin) gets phosphorylated at an intermediate tyrosine site which is captured by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody which eventually acts as a FRET donor. The streptavidin labeled XL-665 binds strongly to the Tk-Biotin substrate and act as a FRET acceptor. The resultant FRET signal is measured at 665 nm. A ratio of this specific fluorescence (665 nm) to the background fluorescence (620 nm), conferred by the free antibody, is directly proportional to the kinase activity. Inhibition of the kinase activity by a pharmacological intervention such as a Btk inhibitor of the present disclosure will result into decreased FRET signal.

After incubating at room temperature for 1 h, an equal volume of stop solution containing 50 mM HEPES pH7.0, 800 mM KF, 20 mM EDTA, 0.1% BSA, Eu cryptate-conjugated p-Tyr66 antibody and streptavidin-labeled XL665 was added to stop the reaction. Plates were further incubated at room temperature for 1 hour, and then the TR-FRET signals (ex337 nm, em 620 nm/665 nm) were read on BMG PHERAstar FS instrument. The residual enzyme activity in presence of increasing concentrations of compounds was calculated based on the ratio of fluorescence at 615 nm to that at 665 nm. The IC50 for each compound was derived from fitting the data to the four-parameter logistic equation by Graphpad Prism software.

In an uninhibited kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide substrate (Tk-Biotin) gets phosphorylated at an intermediate tyrosine site which is captured by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody which eventually acts as a FRET donor. The streptavidin labeled XL-665 binds strongly to the Tk-Biotin substrate and act as a FRET acceptor. The resultant FRET signal is measured at 665 nm. A ratio of this specific fluorescence (665 nm) to the background fluorescence (620 nm), conferred by the free antibody, is directly proportional to the kinase activity.

The assay is based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Europium Cryptate labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and streptavidin labeled fluorophore, XL-665. In an uninhibited kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide substrate (Tk-Biotin) gets phosphorylated at an intermediate tyrosine site which is captured by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody which eventually acts as a FRET donor. The streptavidin labeled XL-665 binds strongly to the Tk-Biotin substrate and act as a FRET acceptor. The resultant FRET signal is measured at 665 nm. A ratio of this specific fluorescence (665 nm) to the background fluorescence (620 nm), conferred by the free antibody, is directly proportional to the kinase activity. Inhibition of the kinase activity by a pharmacological intervention such as a Btk inhibitor of the present disclosure will result into decreased FRET signal.

The assay is based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Europium Cryptate labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and streptavidin labeled fluorophore, XL-665. In an uninhibited kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide substrate (Tk-Biotin) gets phosphorylated at an intermediate tyrosine site which is captured by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody which eventually acts as a FRET donor. The streptavidin labeled XL-665 binds strongly to the Tk-Biotin substrate and act as a FRET acceptor. The resultant FRET signal is measured at 665 nm. A ratio of this specific fluorescence (665 nm) to the background fluorescence (620 nm), conferred by the free antibody, is directly proportional to the kinase activity.

The kinase reactions were started by stepwise addition of 4.5 ul per well of peptide/ATP-solution (4 uM FITC-Ahx-TSELKKVVALYDYMPMNAND-NH2, 164 uM ATP) in kinase buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.02% Tween20, 0.02% BSA, 0.6% DMSO, 10 mM beta-glycerophosphate, and 10 uM sodium orthovanadate, 18 mM MgCl2, 1 mM MnCl2) and 4.5 ul per well of enzyme solution (6.4 nM full-length human recombinant BTK) in kinase buffer. Kinase reactions were incubated at 30° C. for 60 minutes and subsequently terminated by addition of 16 ul per well of stop solution (100 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5% DMSO, 0.1% Caliper coating reagent, 10 mM EDTA, and 0.015% Brij35). Kinase reactions were analyzed on a Caliper LC3000 workstation by separating phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides and kinase activities were calculated from the amounts of newly formed phospho-peptide. Inhibition data were calculated by comparison to control reactions without enzyme (100% inhibition) and without inhibitors (0% inhibition).

The assay is based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Europium Cryptate labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and streptavidin labeled fluorophore, XL-665. In an uninhibited kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide substrate (Tk-Biotin) gets phosphorylated at an intermediate tyrosine site which is captured by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody which eventually acts as a FRET donor. The streptavidin labeled XL-665 binds strongly to the Tk-Biotin substrate and act as a FRET acceptor. The resultant FRET signal is measured at 665 nm. A ratio of this specific fluorescence (665 nm) to the background fluorescence (620 nm), conferred by the free antibody, is directly proportional to the kinase activity.

The assay is based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Europium Cryptate labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and streptavidin labeled fluorophore, XL-665. In an uninhibited kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide substrate (Tk-Biotin) gets phosphorylated at an intermediate tyrosine site which is captured by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody which eventually acts as a FRET donor. The streptavidin labeled XL-665 binds strongly to the Tk-Biotin substrate and act as a FRET acceptor. The resultant FRET signal is measured at 665 nm. A ratio of this specific fluorescence (665 nm) to the background fluorescence (620 nm), conferred by the free antibody, is directly proportional to the kinase activity. Inhibition of the kinase activity by a pharmacological intervention such as a Btk inhibitor of the present disclosure will result into decreased FRET signal.

The assay is based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Europium Cryptate labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and streptavidin labeled fluorophore, XL-665. In an uninhibited kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide substrate (Tk-Biotin) gets phosphorylated at an intermediate tyrosine site which is captured by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody which eventually acts as a FRET donor. The streptavidin labeled XL-665 binds strongly to the Tk-Biotin substrate and act as a FRET acceptor. The resultant FRET signal is measured at 665 nm. A ratio of this specific fluorescence (665 nm) to the background fluorescence (620 nm), conferred by the free antibody, is directly proportional to the kinase activity. Inhibition of the kinase activity by a pharmacological intervention such as a Btk inhibitor of the present disclosure will result into decreased FRET signal.

The assay is based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Europium Cryptate labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and streptavidin labeled fluorophore, XL-665. In an uninhibited kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide substrate (Tk-Biotin) gets phosphorylated at an intermediate tyrosine site which is captured by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody which eventually acts as a FRET donor. The streptavidin labeled XL-665 binds strongly to the Tk-Biotin substrate and act as a FRET acceptor. The resultant FRET signal is measured at 665 nm. A ratio of this specific fluorescence (665 nm) to the background fluorescence (620 nm), conferred by the free antibody, is directly proportional to the kinase activity. Inhibition of the kinase activity by a pharmacological intervention such as a Btk inhibitor of the present disclosure will result into decreased FRET signal.

The assay is based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Europium Cryptate labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and streptavidin labeled fluorophore, XL-665. In an uninhibited kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide substrate (Tk-Biotin) gets phosphorylated at an intermediate tyrosine site which is captured by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody which eventually acts as a FRET donor. The streptavidin labeled XL-665 binds strongly to the Tk-Biotin substrate and act as a FRET acceptor. The resultant FRET signal is measured at 665 nm. A ratio of this specific fluorescence (665 nm) to the background fluorescence (620 nm), conferred by the free antibody, is directly proportional to the kinase activity. Inhibition of the kinase activity by a pharmacological intervention such as a Btk inhibitor of the present disclosure will result into decreased FRET signal.

A ratio of this specific fluorescence (665 nm) to the background fluorescence (620 nm), conferred by the free antibody, is directly proportional to the kinase activity. Inhibition of the kinase activity by a pharmacological intervention such as a Btk inhibitor of the present disclosure will result into decreased FRET signal.

The assay is based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Europium Cryptate labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and streptavidin labeled fluorophore, XL-665. In an uninhibited kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide substrate (Tk-Biotin) gets phosphorylated at an intermediate tyrosine site which is captured by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody which eventually acts as a FRET donor. The streptavidin labeled XL-665 binds strongly to the Tk-Biotin substrate and act as a FRET acceptor. The resultant FRET signal is measured at 665 nm. A ratio of this specific fluorescence (665 nm) to the background fluorescence (620 nm), conferred by the free antibody, is directly proportional to the kinase activity. Inhibition of the kinase activity by a pharmacological intervention such as a Btk inhibitor of the present disclosure will result into decreased FRET signal.

The reactions were initiated by the addition of ATP (at the concentration of ATP Km) and peptide substrate (Biotin-AVLESEEELYSSARQ-NH2). After incubating at room temperature for 1 h, an equal volume of stop solution containing 50 mM HEPES pH7.0, 800 mM KF, 20 mM EDTA, 0.1% BSA, Eu cryptate-conjugated p-Tyr66 antibody and streptavidin-labeled XL665 was added to stop the reaction. Plates were further incubated at room temperature for 1 hour, and then the TR-FRET signals (ex337 nm, em 620 nm/665 nm) were read on BMG PHERAstar FS instrument. The residual enzyme activity in presence of increasing concentrations of compounds was calculated based on the ratio of fluorescence at 615 nm to that at 665 nm. The IC50 for each compound was derived from fitting the data to the four-parameter logistic equation by Graphpad Prism software.

The assay is based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Europium Cryptate labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and streptavidin labeled fluorophore, XL-665. In an uninhibited kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide substrate (Tk-Biotin) gets phosphorylated at an intermediate tyrosine site which is captured by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody which eventually acts as a FRET donor. The streptavidin labeled XL-665 binds strongly to the Tk-Biotin substrate and act as a FRET acceptor. The resultant FRET signal is measured at 665 nm. A ratio of this specific fluorescence (665 nm) to the background fluorescence (620 nm), conferred by the free antibody, is directly proportional to the kinase activity. Inhibition of the kinase activity by a pharmacological intervention such as a Btk inhibitor of the present disclosure will result into decreased FRET signal.

The assay is based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Europium Cryptate labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and streptavidin labeled fluorophore, XL-665. In an uninhibited kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide substrate (Tk-Biotin) gets phosphorylated at an intermediate tyrosine site which is captured by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody which eventually acts as a FRET donor. The streptavidin labeled XL-665 binds strongly to the Tk-Biotin substrate and act as a FRET acceptor. The resultant FRET signal is measured at 665 nm. A ratio of this specific fluorescence (665 nm) to the background fluorescence (620 nm), conferred by the free antibody, is directly proportional to the kinase activity. Inhibition of the kinase activity by a pharmacological intervention such as a Btk inhibitor of the present disclosure will result into decreased FRET signal.

The assay is based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Europium Cryptate labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and streptavidin labeled fluorophore, XL-665. In an uninhibited kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide substrate (Tk-Biotin) gets phosphorylated at an intermediate tyrosine site which is captured by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody which eventually acts as a FRET donor. The streptavidin labeled XL-665 binds strongly to the Tk-Biotin substrate and act as a FRET acceptor. The resultant FRET signal is measured at 665 nm. A ratio of this specific fluorescence (665 nm) to the background fluorescence (620 nm), conferred by the free antibody, is directly proportional to the kinase activity. Inhibition of the kinase activity by a pharmacological intervention such as a Btk inhibitor of the present disclosure will result into decreased FRET signal.

Assays were assembled in 384 well plates where 6 nM of full-length human His-tagged BTK (Life Technologies cat #PV3587) and test compound at varying concentrations were preincubated for 15 minutes at 28Â° C. Then, 1 uM of TK substrate-biotin and 30 uM ATP were added and incubated for an additional 30 minutes at 28Â° C. Phospohrylation was detected by adding 62.5 nM Streptavidin-XL665 and TK-Antibody Cryptate diluted 1:100 in HTRF detection buffer (Cisbio cat #62SDBRDF) and incubated for 60 minutes at RT. The plate was read on an Envision plate reader and the fluoresence is measured at 620 nm (cryptate) and 665 nm (XL665). A ratio is calculated (665/620) and converted to POC relative to control and blank wells.Assay Buffer:50 mM HEPES (Invitrogen #15630), 0.01% Brij-35 (sigma #B4184), 10 mM MgC12 (Sigma M1028), 1 mM EGTA.

The BTK-Eu complex was incubated on ice one hour prior to use at a starting concentration of 50 nM BTK-Bioease: 10 nM Eu-streptavidin (Perkin-Elmer Catalog# AD0062). The assay buffer consisted of 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.15), 0.1 mM DTT, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml BSA with 3% Kinase Stabilizer (Fremont Biosolutions, Catalog #STB-K02). After 1 h, the reaction mixture from above was diluted 10 fold in assay buffer to make 5 nM BTK: 1 nM Eu-Streptavidin complex (donor fluorophore). 18 ul of a mixture of 0.11 nM BTK-Eu and 0.11 nM Kinase Tracer 178 (Invitrogen, Catalog #PV5593,) with BTK-Eu alone as no negative control, was then dispensed into 384-well flat bottom plates (Greiner, 784076). Compounds to be tested in assay were prepared as 10x concentrations and serial dilution in half-log increments was performed in DMSO so as to generate 10 point curves. To initiate the FRET reaction, compounds prepared as 10x stock in DMSO was added to the plates and the plates were incubated 18-24 h at 14° C. After the incubation the plates were read on a BMG Pherastar Fluorescent plate reader (or equivalent) and used to measure the emission energy from the europium donor fluorophore (620 nm emission) and the FRET (665 nm emission). The negative control well values were averaged to obtain the mean minimum. The positive 'no inhibitor' control wells were averaged to obtain the mean maximum.

In an uninhibited kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide substrate (Tk-Biotin) gets phosphorylated at an intermediate tyrosine site which is captured by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody which eventually acts as a FRET donor. The streptavidin labeled XL-665 binds strongly to the Tk-Biotin substrate and act as a FRET acceptor. The resultant FRET signal is measured at 665 nm.
