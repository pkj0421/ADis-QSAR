The assay plates were prepared by addition of 50 nl per well of compound solution in 90% DMSO. The kinase reactions were started by stepwise addition of 4.5 ul per well of peptide/ATP-solution (4 uM FITC-Ahx-TSELKKVVALYDYMPMNAND-NH2, 164 uM ATP) in kinase buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.02% Tween20, 0.02% BSA, 0.6% DMSO, 10 mM beta-glycerophosphate, and 10 uM sodium orthovanadate, 18 mM MgCl2, 1 mM MnCl2) and 4.5 ul per well of enzyme solution (6.4 nM full-length human recombinant BTK) in kinase buffer. Kinase reactions were incubated at 30° C. for 60 minutes and subsequently terminated by addition of 16 ul per well of stop solution (100 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5% DMSO, 0.1% Caliper coating reagent, 10 mM EDTA, and 0.015% Brij35). Kinase reactions were analyzed on a Caliper LC3000 workstation by separating phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides and kinase activities were calculated from the amounts of newly formed phospho-peptide.

The assay is based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Europium Cryptate labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and streptavidin labeled fluorophore, XL-665. In an uninhibited kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide substrate (Tk-Biotin) gets phosphorylated at an intermediate tyrosine site which is captured by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody which eventually acts as a FRET donor. The streptavidin labeled XL-665 binds strongly to the Tk-Biotin substrate and act as a FRET acceptor. The resultant FRET signal is measured at 665 nm. A ratio of this specific fluorescence (665 nm) to the background fluorescence (620 nm), conferred by the free antibody, is directly proportional to the kinase activity.
