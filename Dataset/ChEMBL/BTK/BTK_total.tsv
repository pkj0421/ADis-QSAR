The BTK-Eu complex was incubated on ice one hour prior to use at a starting concentration of 50 nM BTK-Bioease: 10 nM Eu-streptavidin (Perkin-Elmer Catalog# AD0062). The assay buffer consisted of 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.15), 0.1 mM DTT, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml BSA with 3% Kinase Stabilizer (Fremont Biosolutions, Catalog #STB-K02). After 1 h, the reaction mixture from above was diluted 10 fold in assay buffer to make 5 nM BTK: 1 nM Eu-Streptavidin complex (donor fluorophore). 18 ul of a mixture of 0.11 nM BTK-Eu and 0.11 nM Kinase Tracer 178 (Invitrogen, Catalog #PV5593,) with BTK-Eu alone as no negative control, was then dispensed into 384-well flat bottom plates (Greiner, 784076). Compounds to be tested in assay were prepared as 10x concentrations and serial dilution in half-log increments was performed in DMSO so as to generate 10 point curves. To initiate the FRET reaction, compounds prepared as 10x stock in DMSO was added to the plates and the plates were incubated 18-24 h at 14° C. After the incubation the plates were read on a BMG Pherastar Fluorescent plate reader (or equivalent) and used to measure the emission energy from the europium donor fluorophore (620 nm emission) and the FRET (665 nm emission). The negative control well values were averaged to obtain the mean minimum. The positive 'no inhibitor' control wells were averaged to obtain the mean maximum.	single protein format

The assay is based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Europium Cryptate labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and streptavidin labeled fluorophore, XL-665. In an uninhibited kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide substrate (Tk-Biotin) gets phosphorylated at an intermediate tyrosine site which is captured by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody which eventually acts as a FRET donor. The streptavidin labeled XL-665 binds strongly to the Tk-Biotin substrate and act as a FRET acceptor. The resultant FRET signal is measured at 665 nm. A ratio of this specific fluorescence (665 nm) to the background fluorescence (620 nm), conferred by the free antibody, is directly proportional to the kinase activity. Inhibition of the kinase activity by a pharmacological intervention such as a Btk inhibitor of the present disclosure will result into decreased FRET signal.	single protein format

The assay is based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Europium Cryptate labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and streptavidin labeled fluorophore, XL-665. In an uninhibited kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide substrate (Tk-Biotin) gets phosphorylated at an intermediate tyrosine site which is captured by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody which eventually acts as a FRET donor. The streptavidin labeled XL-665 binds strongly to the Tk-Biotin substrate and act as a FRET acceptor. The resultant FRET signal is measured at 665 nm. A ratio of this specific fluorescence (665 nm) to the background fluorescence (620 nm), conferred by the free antibody, is directly proportional to the kinase activity. Inhibition of the kinase activity by a pharmacological intervention such as a Btk inhibitor of the present disclosure will result into decreased FRET signal.	single protein format

The assay is based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Europium Cryptate labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and streptavidin labeled fluorophore, XL-665. In an uninhibited kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide substrate (Tk-Biotin) gets phosphorylated at an intermediate tyrosine site which is captured by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody which eventually acts as a FRET donor. The streptavidin labeled XL-665 binds strongly to the Tk-Biotin substrate and act as a FRET acceptor. The resultant FRET signal is measured at 665 nm. A ratio of this specific fluorescence (665 nm) to the background fluorescence (620 nm), conferred by the free antibody, is directly proportional to the kinase activity. Inhibition of the kinase activity by a pharmacological intervention such as a Btk inhibitor of the present disclosure will result into decreased FRET signal.	single protein format

The assay is based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Europium Cryptate labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and streptavidin labeled fluorophore, XL-665. In an uninhibited kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide substrate (Tk-Biotin) gets phosphorylated at an intermediate tyrosine site which is captured by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody which eventually acts as a FRET donor. The streptavidin labeled XL-665 binds strongly to the Tk-Biotin substrate and act as a FRET acceptor. The resultant FRET signal is measured at 665 nm. A ratio of this specific fluorescence (665 nm) to the background fluorescence (620 nm), conferred by the free antibody, is directly proportional to the kinase activity. Inhibition of the kinase activity by a pharmacological intervention such as a Btk inhibitor of the present disclosure will result into decreased FRET signal.	single protein format

The assay is based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Europium Cryptate labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and streptavidin labeled fluorophore, XL-665. In an uninhibited kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide substrate (Tk-Biotin) gets phosphorylated at an intermediate tyrosine site which is captured by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody which eventually acts as a FRET donor. The streptavidin labeled XL-665 binds strongly to the Tk-Biotin substrate and act as a FRET acceptor. The resultant FRET signal is measured at 665 nm. A ratio of this specific fluorescence (665 nm) to the background fluorescence (620 nm), conferred by the free antibody, is directly proportional to the kinase activity. Inhibition of the kinase activity by a pharmacological intervention such as a Btk inhibitor of the present disclosure will result into decreased FRET signal.	single protein format

After 1 h, the reaction mixture from above was diluted 10 fold in assay buffer to make 5 nM BTK: 1 nM Eu-Streptavidin complex (donor fluorophore). 18 ul of a mixture of 0.11 nM BTK-Eu and 0.11 nM Kinase Tracer 178 (Invitrogen, Catalog #PV5593,) with BTK-Eu alone as no negative control, was then dispensed into 384-well flat bottom plates (Greiner, 784076). Compounds to be tested in assay were prepared as 10x concentrations and serial dilution in half-log increments was performed in DMSO so as to generate 10 point curves. To initiate the FRET reaction, compounds prepared as 10x stock in DMSO was added to the plates and the plates were incubated 18-24 h at 14° C. After the incubation the plates were read on a BMG Pherastar Fluorescent plate reader (or equivalent) and used to measure the emission energy from the europium donor fluorophore (620 nm emission) and the FRET (665 nm emission). The negative control well values were averaged to obtain the mean minimum. The positive 'no inhibitor' control wells were averaged to obtain the mean maximum.	single protein format

The assay is based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Europium Cryptate labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and streptavidin labeled fluorophore, XL-665. In an uninhibited kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide substrate (Tk-Biotin) gets phosphorylated at an intermediate tyrosine site which is captured by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody which eventually acts as a FRET donor. The streptavidin labeled XL-665 binds strongly to the Tk-Biotin substrate and act as a FRET acceptor. The resultant FRET signal is measured at 665 nm. A ratio of this specific fluorescence (665 nm) to the background fluorescence (620 nm), conferred by the free antibody, is directly proportional to the kinase activity. Inhibition of the kinase activity by a pharmacological intervention such as a Btk inhibitor of the present disclosure will result into decreased FRET signal.	single protein format

Recombinant Btk was pre-incubated with the compounds disclosed herein at room temperature for 1 hour in an assay buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DT, 20 nM SEB, 0.1% BSA, 0.005% tween-20. The reactions were initiated by the addition of ATP (at the concentration of ATP Km) and peptide substrate (Biotin-AVLESEEELYSSARQ-NH2). After incubating at room temperature for 1 h, an equal volume of stop solution containing 50 mM HEPES pH7.0, 800 mM KF, 20 mM EDTA, 0.1% BSA, Eu cryptate-conjugated p-Tyr66 antibody and streptavidin-labeled XL665 was added to stop the reaction. Plates were further incubated at room temperature for 1 hour, and then the TR-FRET signals (ex337 nm, em 620 nm/665 nm) were read on BMG PHERAstar FS instrument. The residual enzyme activity in presence of increasing concentrations of compounds was calculated based on the ratio of fluorescence at 615 nm to that at 665 nm. The IC50 for each compound was derived from fitting the data to the four-parameter logistic equation by Graphpad Prism software.	single protein format

The assay is based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Europium Cryptate labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and streptavidin labeled fluorophore, XL-665. In an uninhibited kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide substrate (Tk-Biotin) gets phosphorylated at an intermediate tyrosine site which is captured by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody which eventually acts as a FRET donor. The streptavidin labeled XL-665 binds strongly to the Tk-Biotin substrate and act as a FRET acceptor. The resultant FRET signal is measured at 665 nm. A ratio of this specific fluorescence (665 nm) to the background fluorescence (620 nm), conferred by the free antibody, is directly proportional to the kinase activity. Inhibition of the kinase activity by a pharmacological intervention such as a Btk inhibitor of the present disclosure will result into decreased FRET signal.	single protein format

The assay is based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Europium Cryptate labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and streptavidin labeled fluorophore, XL-665. In an uninhibited kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide substrate (Tk-Biotin) gets phosphorylated at an intermediate tyrosine site which is captured by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody which eventually acts as a FRET donor. The streptavidin labeled XL-665 binds strongly to the Tk-Biotin substrate and act as a FRET acceptor. The resultant FRET signal is measured at 665 nm. A ratio of this specific fluorescence (665 nm) to the background fluorescence (620 nm), conferred by the free antibody, is directly proportional to the kinase activity. Inhibition of the kinase activity by a pharmacological intervention such as a Btk inhibitor of the present disclosure will result into decreased FRET signal.	single protein format

Kinase reactions were incubated at 30° C. for 60 minutes and subsequently terminated by addition of 16 ul per well of stop solution (100 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5% DMSO, 0.1% Caliper coating reagent, 10 mM EDTA, and 0.015% Brij35). Kinase reactions were analyzed on a Caliper LC3000 workstation by separating phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides and kinase activities were calculated from the amounts of newly formed phospho-peptide. Inhibition data were calculated by comparison to control reactions without enzyme (100% inhibition) and without inhibitors (0% inhibition).	single protein format

The BTK-Eu complex was incubated on ice one hour prior to use at a starting concentration of 50 nM BTK-Bioease: 10 nM Eu-streptavidin (Perkin-Elmer Catalog# AD0062). The assay buffer consisted of 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.15), 0.1 mM DTT, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml BSA with 3% Kinase Stabilizer (Fremont Biosolutions, Catalog #STB-K02). After 1 h, the reaction mixture from above was diluted 10 fold in assay buffer to make 5 nM BTK: 1 nM Eu-Streptavidin complex (donor fluorophore). 18 ul of a mixture of 0.11 nM BTK-Eu and 0.11 nM Kinase Tracer 178 (Invitrogen, Catalog #PV5593,) with BTK-Eu alone as no negative control, was then dispensed into 384-well flat bottom plates (Greiner, 784076). Compounds to be tested in assay were prepared as 10x concentrations and serial dilution in half-log increments was performed in DMSO so as to generate 10 point curves. To initiate the FRET reaction, compounds prepared as 10x stock in DMSO was added to the plates and the plates were incubated 18-24 h at 14° C. After the incubation the plates were read on a BMG Pherastar Fluorescent plate reader (or equivalent) and used to measure the emission energy from the europium donor fluorophore (620 nm emission) and the FRET (665 nm emission). The negative control well values were averaged to obtain the mean minimum. The positive 'no inhibitor' control wells were averaged to obtain the mean maximum.	single protein format

After incubating at room temperature for 60 min, the reaction was terminated by adding 45 ul of 35 mM EDTA to each sample. The reaction mixture was analyzed on the Caliper LABCHIP 3000 (Caliper, Hopkinton, Mass.) by electrophoretic separation of the fluorescent substrate and phosphorylated product. Inhibition data were calculated by comparison to no enzyme control reactions for 100% inhibition and no inhibitor controls for 0% inhibition. Dose response curves were generated to determine the concentration required inhibiting 50% of kinase activity (IC50). Compounds were dissolved at 10 mM in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and evaluated at eleven concentrations.	single protein format
