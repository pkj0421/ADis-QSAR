The BTK-Eu complex was incubated on ice one hour prior to use at a starting concentration of 50 nM BTK-Bioease: 10 nM Eu-streptavidin (Perkin-Elmer Catalog# AD0062). The assay buffer consisted of 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.15), 0.1 mM DTT, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml BSA with 3% Kinase Stabilizer (Fremont Biosolutions, Catalog #STB-K02). After 1 h, the reaction mixture from above was diluted 10 fold in assay buffer to make 5 nM BTK: 1 nM Eu-Streptavidin complex (donor fluorophore). 18 ul of a mixture of 0.11 nM BTK-Eu and 0.11 nM Kinase Tracer 178 (Invitrogen, Catalog #PV5593,) with BTK-Eu alone as no negative control, was then dispensed into 384-well flat bottom plates (Greiner, 784076). Compounds to be tested in assay were prepared as 10x concentrations and serial dilution in half-log increments was performed in DMSO so as to generate 10 point curves. To initiate the FRET reaction, compounds prepared as 10x stock in DMSO was added to the plates and the plates were incubated 18-24 h at 14° C. After the incubation the plates were read on a BMG Pherastar Fluorescent plate reader (or equivalent) and used to measure the emission energy from the europium donor fluorophore (620 nm emission) and the FRET (665 nm emission). The negative control well values were averaged to obtain the mean minimum. The positive 'no inhibitor' control wells were averaged to obtain the mean maximum.	single protein format

After incubating at room temperature for 60 min, the reaction was terminated by adding 45 ul of 35 mM EDTA to each sample. The reaction mixture was analyzed on the Caliper LABCHIP 3000 (Caliper, Hopkinton, Mass.) by electrophoretic separation of the fluorescent substrate and phosphorylated product. Inhibition data were calculated by comparison to no enzyme control reactions for 100% inhibition and no inhibitor controls for 0% inhibition.

Serial dilutions of test compounds were incubated with human recombinant Btk (2 nM), ATP (40 μM) and a phosphoacceptor peptide substrate FAM-GEEPLYWSFPAKKK-NH2 (1 μM) at room temperature for 3 h. The reaction was then terminated with EDTA, final concentration 20 mM and the phosphorylated reaction product was quantified on a Caliper Desktop Profiler (Caliper LabChip 3000). Percent inhibition was calculated for each compound dilution and the concentration that produced 50% inhibition was calculated.	single protein format

Test compounds were diluted to desired concentrations in kinase reaction buffer and briefly incubated with recombinant full-length human BTK kinase with a (His)6 tag (81.3 kDa; Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, Calif.). The assay as described is based on volumes used in a standard 384 well format using solid, white-wall plates. The reaction was subsequently initiated by the addition of ATP and myelin basic protein (MBP) substrate (Millipore Corporation, Waltham, Mass.). Composition of the assay reaction mixture (5 mL volume) was: 5% v/v DMSO, 60 nM BTK, 1.6 μM ATP, and 20 μM MBP substrate. After incubation at room temperature for 60 min, 5 mL of the ADP-Glo reagent (Promega Corporation, Madison, Wis.) was added to each well and incubated for an additional 40 minutes.	single protein format
