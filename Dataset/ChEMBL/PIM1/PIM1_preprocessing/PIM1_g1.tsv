This solution is incubated at 30 degrees Celsius at 360 rpm for two hours. Following the incubation, 50 ul of Kinase-Glo reagent is added to each well, including all positive and negative control wells, and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. The plate is then read by the Luminoskan Ascent instrument and the results displayed with the Ascent Software version 2.6.

The phosphorylation of biotinylated-BAD (S112) peptide by full length recombinant Pim-1, Pim-2, or Pim-3 protein was detected with streptavidin:Allophycocyanin (APC) conjugate and a europium (Eu) labeled antibody directed against phosphorylated-BAD (S112). Excitation of Eu by a high energy laser light (337 nm) leads to a transfer of energy to the APC molecule, and results in an emission at 665 nm. The fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of phosphorylated BAD peptide present in the reaction.Compounds were prepared in DMSO by conducting 3-fold serial dilutions to give a 10-point dosing curve having a high dose of 1 uM.

The phosphorylation of biotinylated-BAD (S112) peptide by full length recombinant Pim-1, Pim-2, or Pim-3 protein was detected with streptavidin:Allophycocyanin (APC) conjugate and a europium (Eu) labeled antibody directed against phosphorylated-BAD (S112).

The fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of phosphorylated BAD peptide present in the reaction. Compounds were prepared in DMSO by conducting 3-fold serial dilutions to give a 10-point dosing curve having a high dose of 1 μM. A reference compound was included on each assay plate in order to validate that plate; on one plate of every assay run, two additional reference compounds were included. The final buffer conditions were as follows: 60 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.05% BSA, 2 mM DTT.
