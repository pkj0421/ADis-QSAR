All assay reaction conditions for IC50 determinations were within the linear range with respect to time and enzyme concentration. In a 384 well polypropylene plate, TrkA (0.4 nM, Carna 08-186) was pre-incubated in a 100 mM Hepes-NaOH pH 7.5 buffer containing 0.01% Triton X-100, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1% BSA, 1 mM DTT, 10 uM sodium orthovanadate and 10 uM beta-glycerophosphate and compound with a concentration of 2.5% DMSO for 15 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was initiated with an equal volume of peptide substrate (Caliper Life Sciences catalog no. 760430) and ATP in the aforementioned buffer. The final concentrations in the reaction were 200 pM TrkA, 1.5 uM peptide substrate and 55 uM ATP (ATP Km). The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 180 minutes and terminated with a buffer containing excess EDTA (100 mM Hepes-NaOH pH 7.5, 0.02% Brij.	single protein format
