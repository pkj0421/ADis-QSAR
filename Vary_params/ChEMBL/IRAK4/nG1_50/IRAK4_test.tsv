For purified recombinant IRAK-1 protein kinase assay, 50 uM ATP was used. A 25 ul aliquot of the reaction mixture was transferred on to p81 phosphocellulose squares (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, N.Y.). The assay squares were washed three times with 0.75% phosphoric acid and once with acetone. Enzyme activity was measured by determining the bound radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting.
