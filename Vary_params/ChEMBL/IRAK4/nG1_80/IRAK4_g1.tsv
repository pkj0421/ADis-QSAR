For purified recombinant IRAK-1 protein kinase assay, 50 uM ATP was used. A 25 ul aliquot of the reaction mixture was transferred on to p81 phosphocellulose squares (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, N.Y.). The assay squares were washed three times with 0.75% phosphoric acid and once with acetone. Enzyme activity was measured by determining the bound radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting.

The extent of phosphorylation is measured using the IMAP technology (Molecular Devices) where the phosphorylated fluorescent substrate binds to the large M(III)-based nanoparticles which reduces the rotational speed of the substrate and thus increases its fluorescent polarization (FP). 20 μl reaction mixture contains 10 mM TriHCl, pH 7.2, 0.5 nM GST tagged IRAK-4 (SignalChem), 100 nM fluorescent peptide substrate (RP7030, Molecular Devices), 100 μM ATP, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM MgCl2, and 0.01% Tween 20. The reaction is initiated by the addition of ATP. After incubation for 30 minutes at 25° C., 60 μl of Progressive IMAP Reagent (Molecular Devices) is added to stop the reaction. Change in RP7030's FP is determined by a FP reader (Analyst HT, LH, BioSystems).

The reaction was initiated by the combination of IRAK4 with substrates and test compounds. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 60 min. and terminated by adding 45 μL of 35 mM EDTA to each sample. The reaction mixture was analyzed on the Caliper LabChip 3000 (Caliper, Hopkinton, Mass.) by electrophoretic separation of the fluorescent substrate and phosphorylated product. Inhibition data were calculated by comparison to no enzyme control reactions for 100% inhibition and vehicle-only reactions for 0% inhibition. The final concentrations of reagents in the assays are ATP, 500 μM; FL-IPTSPITTTYFFFKKK peptide 1.5 μM; IRAK4, 0.6 nM; and DMSO, 1.6%.
