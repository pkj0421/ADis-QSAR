The catalytic activity of the GST-Syk kinase fusion protein was determined using the Kinase Glo Luminescence Kinase test (Promega; V6712). In this homogeneous test the amount of ATP remaining after the kinase reaction is quantified by a luciferin-luciferase reaction using luminescence. The luminescence signal obtained correlates with the amount of ATP still present and thus correlates inversely with the activity of the protein kinase. The test compounds were dissolved in 100% DMSO at a concentration of 10 mM and diluted in DMSO to a concentration of 1 mM.

The off-chip incubation mobility-shift kinase assay uses a microfluidic chip to measure the conversion of a fluorescent peptide substrate to a phosphorylated product. The reaction mixture, from a microtiter plate well, is introduced through a capillary sipper onto the chip, where the nonphosphorylated substrate and phosphorylated product are separated by electrophoresis and detected via laser induced fluorescence. The signature of the fluorescence signal over time reveals the extent of the reaction. The phosphorylated product migrates through the chip faster than the non-phosphorylated substrate, and signals from the two forms of the peptide appear as distinct peaks.
