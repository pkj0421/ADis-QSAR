Following the incubation, the stop solution made with EDTA, water, and Lance detection buffer (PERKINELMER) was added (12 uL each) to stop phosphorylation. Following the addition of the stop solution and 5 minutes of shaking.

The recombinant human GST-Syk (Carna Biosciences #08-176) (5 pM final concentration) was incubated with various concentrations of the inhibitor diluted in DMSO (0.1% final concentration) for 10 minutes at room temperature in 15 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.01% tween 20, 2 mM DTT in 384 well plate format. To initiate the reaction the biotinylated substrate peptide (250 nM final concentration) that contains the phosphorylation site for Syk was added with magnesium (5 mM final concentration) and ATP (25 uM final concentration). Final volume of the reaction was 10 uL. Phosphorylation of the peptide was allowed to proceed for 45x at room temperature. To quench the reaction and detect the phosphorylated product, 2 nM of a Europium-anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Perkin Elmer #AD0161) and 70 nM SA-APC (Perkin-Elmer #CR130-100) were added together in 15 mM Tris pH 7.5.
