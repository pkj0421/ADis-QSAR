The assay is based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Europium Cryptate labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and streptavidin labeled fluorophore, XL-665. In an uninhibited kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide substrate (Tk-Biotin) gets phosphorylated at an intermediate tyrosine site which is captured by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody which eventually acts as a FRET donor. The streptavidin labeled XL-665 binds strongly to the Tk-Biotin substrate and act as a FRET acceptor. The resultant FRET signal is measured at 665 nm. A ratio of this specific fluorescence (665 nm) to the background fluorescence (620 nm), conferred by the free antibody, is directly proportional to the kinase activity. Inhibition of the kinase activity by a pharmacological intervention such as a Btk inhibitor of the present disclosure will result into decreased FRET signal.

The reactions were initiated by the addition of ATP (at the concentration of ATP Km) and peptide substrate (Biotin-AVLESEEELYSSARQ-NH2). After incubating at room temperature for 1 h, an equal volume of stop solution containing 50 mM HEPES pH7.0, 800 mM KF, 20 mM EDTA, 0.1% BSA, Eu cryptate-conjugated p-Tyr66 antibody and streptavidin-labeled XL665 was added to stop the reaction. Plates were further incubated at room temperature for 1 hour, and then the TR-FRET signals (ex337 nm, em 620 nm/665 nm) were read on BMG PHERAstar FS instrument. The residual enzyme activity in presence of increasing concentrations of compounds was calculated based on the ratio of fluorescence at 615 nm to that at 665 nm. The IC50 for each compound was derived from fitting the data to the four-parameter logistic equation by Graphpad Prism software.

Alternatively, the Lanthascreen assay can be used to evaluate Btk activity through quantification of its phosphorylated peptide product. The FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) that occurs between the fluorescein on the peptide product and the terbium on the detection antibody decreases with the addition of inhibitors of Btk that reduce the phosphorylation of the peptide.

The assay is based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Europium Cryptate labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and streptavidin labeled fluorophore, XL-665. In an uninhibited kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide substrate (Tk-Biotin) gets phosphorylated at an intermediate tyrosine site which is captured by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody which eventually acts as a FRET donor. The streptavidin labeled XL-665 binds strongly to the Tk-Biotin substrate and act as a FRET acceptor. The resultant FRET signal is measured at 665 nm. A ratio of this specific fluorescence (665 nm) to the background fluorescence (620 nm), conferred by the free antibody, is directly proportional to the kinase activity. Inhibition of the kinase activity by a pharmacological intervention such as a Btk inhibitor of the present disclosure will result into decreased FRET signal.
