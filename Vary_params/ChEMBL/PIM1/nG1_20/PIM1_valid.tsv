The phosphorylation of biotinylated-BAD (S112) peptide by full length recombinant Pim-1, Pim-2, or Pim-3 protein was detected with streptavidin:Allophycocyanin (APC) conjugate and a europium (Eu) labeled antibody directed against phosphorylated-BAD (S112). Excitation of Eu by a high energy laser light (337 nm) leads to a transfer of energy to the APC molecule, and results in an emission at 665 nm.

Compounds to be tested are dissolved in 100% DMSO and directly distributed into white 384-well plates at 0.5 μl per well. To start the reaction, 10 μl of 5 nM Pim1 kinase and 80 μM BAD peptide (RSRHSSYPAGT-OH) in assay buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT, 0.05% BSA) is added into each well. After 15 minutes, 10 μl of 40 μM ATP in assay buffer is added. Final assay concentrations are 2.5 nM PIM1, 20 μM ATP, 40 μM BAD peptide and 2.5% DMSO. The reaction is performed until approximately 50% of the ATP is depleted, then stopped with the addition of 20 μl KinaseGlo Plus (Promega Corporation) solution. The stopped reaction is incubated for 10 minutes and the remaining ATP detected via luminescence on the Victor2 (Perkin Elmer).

Compounds to be tested are dissolved in 100% DMSO and directly distributed into white 384-well plates at 0.5 uA per well. To start the reaction, 10 ul of 5 nM Pim1 kinase and 80 uM BAD peptide (RSRHSSYPAGT-OH) in assay buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.05% BSA) is added into each well. After 15 minutes, 10 ul of 40 uM ATP in assay buffer is added. Final assay concentrations are 2.5 nM PIM1, 20 uM ATP, 40 uM BAD peptide and 2.5% DMSO. The reaction is performed until approximately 50% of the ATP is depleted, then stopped with the addition of 20 ul KinaseGlo Plus (Promega Corporation) solution. The stopped reaction is incubated for 10 minutes and the remaining ATP detected via luminescence on the Victor2 (Perkin Elmer).
