The phosphorylation of biotinylated-BAD (S112) peptide by full length recombinant Pim-1, Pim-2, or Pim-3 protein was detected with streptavidin:Allophycocyanin (APC) conjugate and a europium (Eu) labeled antibody directed against phosphorylated-BAD (S112). Excitation of Eu by a high energy laser light (337 nm) leads to a transfer of energy to the APC molecule, and results in an emission at 665 nm. The fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of phosphorylated BAD peptide present in the reaction. Compounds were prepared in DMSO by conducting 3-fold serial dilutions to give a 10-point dosing curve having a high dose of 1 μM. A reference compound was included on each assay plate in order to validate that plate; on one plate of every assay run, two additional reference compounds were included. The final buffer conditions were as follows: 60 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.05% BSA, 2 mM DTT. Incubations were carried out at RT (22° C.) for 2 h for Pim-1, 1 hour and 30 min for Pim-3, and 45 min for Pim-2. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 3 mM EDTA, and fluorescence was measured by an HTRF® Rubystar microplate reader.

The phosphorylation of biotinylated-BAD (S112) peptide by full length recombinant Pim-1, Pim-2, or Pim-3 protein was detected with streptavidin:Allophycocyanin (APC) conjugate and a europium (Eu) labeled antibody directed against phosphorylated-BAD (S112).

The fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of phosphorylated BAD peptide present in the reaction. Compounds were prepared in DMSO by conducting 3-fold serial dilutions to give a 10-point dosing curve having a high dose of 1 μM. A reference compound was included on each assay plate in order to validate that plate; on one plate of every assay run, two additional reference compounds were included. The final buffer conditions were as follows: 60 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.05% BSA, 2 mM DTT. Incubations were carried out at RT (22° C.) for 2 h for Pim-1, 1 hour and 30 min for Pim-3, and 45 min for Pim-2.

The reaction is performed until approximately 50% of the ATP is depleted, then stopped with the addition of 20 ul KinaseGlo Plus (Promega Corporation) solution.

The phosphorylation of biotinylated-BAD (S112) peptide by full length recombinant Pim-1, Pim-2, or Pim-3 protein was detected with streptavidin:Allophycocyanin (APC) conjugate and a europium (Eu) labeled antibody directed against phosphorylated-BAD (S112). Excitation of Eu by a high energy laser light (337 nm) leads to a transfer of energy to the APC molecule, and results in an emission at 665 nm. The fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of phosphorylated BAD peptide present in the reaction. Compounds were prepared in DMSO by conducting 3-fold serial dilutions to give a 10-point dosing curve having a high dose of 1 μM. A reference compound was included on each assay plate in order to validate that plate; on one plate of every assay run, two additional reference compounds were included. The final buffer conditions were as follows: 60 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.05% BSA, 2 mM DTT. Incubations were carried out at RT (22° C.) for 2 h for Pim-1, 1 hour and 30 min for Pim-3, and 45 min for Pim-2. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 3 mM EDTA, and fluorescence was measured by an HTRF® Rubystar microplate reader.
