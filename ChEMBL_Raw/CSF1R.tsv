Science (2000) 289: 1938-1942). In this assay, the oxidation of NADH (thus the decrease at A340 nm) was continuously monitored spectrophometrically. The reaction mixture (100 .mu.L) contained FMS (purchased from Millipore) (10 nM), polyE4Y (1 mg/mL), MgCl.sub.2 (10 mM), pyruvate kinase (4 units), lactate dehydrogenase (0.7 units), phosphoenol pyruvate (1 mM), NADH (0.28 mM) and ATP (500 .mu.M) in 90 mM Tris buffer containing 0.2% octyl-glucoside and 1% DMSO, pH 7.5. The inhibition reaction was started by mixing serial diluted test compound with the above reaction mixture. The absorption at 340 nm was monitored continuously for 4 hours at 30.degree.

ID no. 1) was determined by following the production of ADP from the FMS kinase reaction with ATP and poly E4Y as substrates through coupling with the pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase system (e.g., Schindler et al. Science (2000) 289: 1938-1942). In this assay, the oxidation of NADH (thus the decrease at A340 nm) was continuously monitored spectrophometrically. The reaction mixture (100 .mu.L) contained FMS (purchased from Millipore) (10 nM), polyE4Y (1 mg/mL), MgCl.sub.2 (10 mM), pyruvate kinase (4 units), lactate dehydrogenase (0.7 units), phosphoenol pyruvate (1 mM), NADH (0.28 mM) and ATP (500 .mu.M) in 90 mM Tris buffer containing 0.2% octyl-glucoside and 1% DMSO, pH 7.5. The inhibition reaction was started by mixing serial diluted test compound with the above reaction mixture. The absorption at 340 nm was monitored continuously for 4 hours at 30.degree.

The assay was performed in black 96-well microplates (Cat #42-000-0117, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.). To each well, 5 uL of compound (in 4% DMSO) were mixed with 2 uL of 3.5 nM CSF-1R, 25 mM MgCl2 in assay buffer (100 mM HEPES (hydroxyethylpiperazineethylsodiumsulfonate), pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT (dithiothreitol), 0.01% Tween-20), and 2 uL of 1540 uM peptide in assay buffer. The kinase reaction was initiated by adding 1 Î¼L of 10 mM ATP in assay buffer. The final concentrations in the 10 uL reaction mixture were 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% Tween-20, 2% DMSO, 308 uM SYEGNSYTFIDPTQ, 1 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.7 nM CSF-1R.

The assay was performed in black 96-well microplates (Cat #42-000-0117, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.). To each well, 5 uL of compound (in 4% DMSO) were mixed with 2 uL of 3.5 nM CSF-1R, 25 mM MgCl2 in assay buffer (100 mM HEPES (hydroxyethylpiperazineethylsodiumsulfonate), pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT (dithiothreitol), 0.01% Tween-20), and 2 uL of 1540 uM peptide in assay buffer. The kinase reaction was initiated by adding 1 Î¼L of 10 mM ATP in assay buffer. The final concentrations in the 10 uL reaction mixture were 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% Tween-20, 2% DMSO, 308 uM SYEGNSYTFIDPTQ, 1 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.7 nM CSF-1R. Positive and negative control wells were included on each plate, where 4% DMSO in assay buffer was substituted for the compound; in addition, positive control wells received 1.2 uL of 50 mM EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) before the start of the reaction."

The assay was performed in black 96-well microplates (Cat #42-000-0117, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.). To each well, 5 uL of compound (in 4% DMSO) were mixed with 2 uL of 3.5 nM CSF-1R, 25 mM MgCl2 in assay buffer (100 mM HEPES (hydroxyethylpiperazineethylsodiumsulfonate), pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT (dithiothreitol), 0.01% Tween-20), and 2 uL of 1540 uM peptide in assay buffer. The kinase reaction was initiated by adding 1 Î¼L of 10 mM ATP in assay buffer. The final concentrations in the 10 uL reaction mixture were 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% Tween-20, 2% DMSO, 308 uM SYEGNSYTFIDPTQ, 1 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.7 nM CSF-1R.

Incubation mixtures contained the following: 50 mM NaHEPES, pH 7.3, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM MnCl2, 0.01% Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT, 1% DMSO, 10 uM ATP, 25 nM LANCE Ultra ULight-poly GAT and 0.5 nM cFMS in a total volume of 10 uL. The concentration of compounds of Formula I was varied over 10-point, 3-fold dilution series with 10,000 nM typically being the highest dose. Incubations were carried out in white ProxyPlate-384 Plus plates (PerkinElmer) at 22 C. for 20 minutes, after which 10 uL of a quench/detection solution was added containing 1x LANCE Detection Buffer, 2 nM LANCE EuW1024 Anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20) and 36 mM EDTA. After an additional 60 minutes incubation at 22 C., the assay plate was read on an EnVision 2103 Multilabel Reader (PerkinElmer)."

The kinase reaction was initiated by adding 1 Î¼L of 10 mM ATP in assay buffer. The final concentrations in the 10 uL reaction mixture were 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% Tween-20, 2% DMSO, 308 uM SYEGNSYTFIDPTQ, 1 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.7 nM CSF-1R. Positive and negative control wells were included on each plate, where 4% DMSO in assay buffer was substituted for the compound; in addition, positive control wells received 1.2 uL of 50 mM EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) before the start of the reaction."

The assay was performed in black 96-well microplates (Cat #42-000-0117, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.). To each well, 5 uL of compound (in 4% DMSO) were mixed with 2 uL of 3.5 nM CSF-1R, 25 mM MgCl2 in assay buffer (100 mM HEPES (hydroxyethylpiperazineethylsodiumsulfonate), pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT (dithiothreitol), 0.01% Tween-20), and 2 uL of 1540 uM peptide in assay buffer. The kinase reaction was initiated by adding 1 Î¼L of 10 mM ATP in assay buffer. The final concentrations in the 10 uL reaction mixture were 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% Tween-20, 2% DMSO, 308 uM SYEGNSYTFIDPTQ, 1 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.7 nM CSF-1R. Positive and negative control wells were included on each plate, where 4% DMSO in assay buffer was substituted for the compound; in addition, positive control wells received 1.2 uL of 50 mM EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) before the start of the reaction."

The assay was performed in black 96-well microplates (Cat #42-000-0117, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.). To each well, 5 uL of compound (in 4% DMSO) were mixed with 2 uL of 3.5 nM CSF-1R, 25 mM MgCl2 in assay buffer (100 mM HEPES (hydroxyethylpiperazineethylsodiumsulfonate), pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT (dithiothreitol), 0.01% Tween-20), and 2 uL of 1540 uM peptide in assay buffer. The kinase reaction was initiated by adding 1 Î¼L of 10 mM ATP in assay buffer. The final concentrations in the 10 uL reaction mixture were 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% Tween-20, 2% DMSO, 308 uM SYEGNSYTFIDPTQ, 1 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.7 nM CSF-1R.

Incubation mixtures contained the following: 50 mM NaHEPES, pH 7.3, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM MnCl2, 0.01% Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT, 1% DMSO, 10 uM ATP, 25 nM LANCE Ultra ULight-poly GAT and 0.5 nM cFMS in a total volume of 10 uL.

Incubation mixtures contained the following: 50 mM NaHEPES, pH 7.3, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM MnCl2, 0.01% Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT, 1% DMSO, 10 uM ATP, 25 nM LANCE Ultra ULight-poly GAT and 0.5 nM cFMS in a total volume of 10 uL. The concentration of compounds of Formula I was varied over 10-point, 3-fold dilution series with 10,000 nM typically being the highest dose. Incubations were carried out in white ProxyPlate-384 Plus plates (PerkinElmer) at 22 C. for 20 minutes, after which 10 uL of a quench/detection solution was added containing 1x LANCE Detection Buffer, 2 nM LANCE EuW1024 Anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20) and 36 mM EDTA.

To each well, 5 uL of compound (in 4% DMSO) were mixed with 2 uL of 3.5 nM CSF-1R, 25 mM MgCl2 in assay buffer (100 mM HEPES (hydroxyethylpiperazineethylsodiumsulfonate), pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT (dithiothreitol), 0.01% Tween-20), and 2 uL of 1540 uM peptide in assay buffer. The kinase reaction was initiated by adding 1 Î¼L of 10 mM ATP in assay buffer. The final concentrations in the 10 uL reaction mixture were 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% Tween-20, 2% DMSO, 308 uM SYEGNSYTFIDPTQ, 1 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.7 nM CSF-1R. Positive and negative control wells were included on each plate, where 4% DMSO in assay buffer was substituted for the compound; in addition, positive control wells received 1.2 uL of 50 mM EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) before the start of the reaction."

Incubation mixtures contained the following: 50 mM NaHEPES, pH 7.3, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM MnCl2, 0.01% Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT, 1% DMSO, 10 uM ATP, 25 nM LANCE Ultra ULight-poly GAT and 0.5 nM cFMS in a total volume of 10 uL. The concentration of compounds of Formula I was varied over 10-point, 3-fold dilution series with 10,000 nM typically being the highest dose. Incubations were carried out in white ProxyPlate-384 Plus plates (PerkinElmer) at 22 C. for 20 minutes, after which 10 uL of a quench/detection solution was added containing 1x LANCE Detection Buffer, 2 nM LANCE EuW1024 Anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20) and 36 mM EDTA. After an additional 60 minutes incubation at 22 C., the assay plate was read on an EnVision 2103 Multilabel Reader (PerkinElmer)."

Incubation mixtures contained the following: 50 mM NaHEPES, pH 7.3, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM MnCl2, 0.01% Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT, 1% DMSO, 10 uM ATP, 25 nM LANCE Ultra ULight-poly GAT and 0.5 nM cFMS in a total volume of 10 uL. The concentration of compounds of Formula I was varied over 10-point, 3-fold dilution series with 10,000 nM typically being the highest dose. Incubations were carried out in white ProxyPlate-384 Plus plates (PerkinElmer) at 22 C. for 20 minutes, after which 10 uL of a quench/detection solution was added containing 1x LANCE Detection Buffer, 2 nM LANCE EuW1024 Anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20) and 36 mM EDTA.

The assay was performed in black 96-well microplates (Cat #42-000-0117, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.). To each well, 5 uL of compound (in 4% DMSO) were mixed with 2 uL of 3.5 nM CSF-1R, 25 mM MgCl2 in assay buffer (100 mM HEPES (hydroxyethylpiperazineethylsodiumsulfonate), pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT (dithiothreitol), 0.01% Tween-20), and 2 uL of 1540 uM peptide in assay buffer. The kinase reaction was initiated by adding 1 Î¼L of 10 mM ATP in assay buffer. The final concentrations in the 10 uL reaction mixture were 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% Tween-20, 2% DMSO, 308 uM SYEGNSYTFIDPTQ, 1 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.7 nM CSF-1R. Positive and negative control wells were included on each plate, where 4% DMSO in assay buffer was substituted for the compound; in addition, positive control wells received 1.2 uL of 50 mM EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) before the start of the reaction."

The assay was performed in black 96-well microplates (Cat #42-000-0117, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.). To each well, 5 uL of compound (in 4% DMSO) were mixed with 2 uL of 3.5 nM CSF-1R, 25 mM MgCl2 in assay buffer (100 mM HEPES (hydroxyethylpiperazineethylsodiumsulfonate), pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT (dithiothreitol), 0.01% Tween-20), and 2 uL of 1540 uM peptide in assay buffer. The kinase reaction was initiated by adding 1 Î¼L of 10 mM ATP in assay buffer. The final concentrations in the 10 uL reaction mixture were 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% Tween-20, 2% DMSO, 308 uM SYEGNSYTFIDPTQ, 1 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.7 nM CSF-1R. Positive and negative control wells were included on each plate, where 4% DMSO in assay buffer was substituted for the compound; in addition, positive control wells received 1.2 uL of 50 mM EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) before the start of the reaction."

The assay was performed in black 96-well microplates (Cat #42-000-0117, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.). To each well, 5 uL of compound (in 4% DMSO) were mixed with 2 uL of 3.5 nM CSF-1R, 25 mM MgCl2 in assay buffer (100 mM HEPES (hydroxyethylpiperazineethylsodiumsulfonate), pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT (dithiothreitol), 0.01% Tween-20), and 2 uL of 1540 uM peptide in assay buffer. The kinase reaction was initiated by adding 1 Î¼L of 10 mM ATP in assay buffer. The final concentrations in the 10 uL reaction mixture were 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% Tween-20, 2% DMSO, 308 uM SYEGNSYTFIDPTQ, 1 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.7 nM CSF-1R.

The kinase reaction was initiated by adding 1 Î¼L of 10 mM ATP in assay buffer. The final concentrations in the 10 uL reaction mixture were 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% Tween-20, 2% DMSO, 308 uM SYEGNSYTFIDPTQ, 1 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.7 nM CSF-1R. Positive and negative control wells were included on each plate, where 4% DMSO in assay buffer was substituted for the compound; in addition, positive control wells received 1.2 uL of 50 mM EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) before the start of the reaction."

The assay was performed in black 96-well microplates (Cat #42-000-0117, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.). To each well, 5 uL of compound (in 4% DMSO) were mixed with 2 uL of 3.5 nM CSF-1R, 25 mM MgCl2 in assay buffer (100 mM HEPES (hydroxyethylpiperazineethylsodiumsulfonate), pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT (dithiothreitol), 0.01% Tween-20), and 2 uL of 1540 uM peptide in assay buffer. The kinase reaction was initiated by adding 1 Î¼L of 10 mM ATP in assay buffer. The final concentrations in the 10 uL reaction mixture were 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% Tween-20, 2% DMSO, 308 uM SYEGNSYTFIDPTQ, 1 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.7 nM CSF-1R. Positive and negative control wells were included on each plate, where 4% DMSO in assay buffer was substituted for the compound; in addition, positive control wells received 1.2 uL of 50 mM EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) before the start of the reaction."

The assay was performed in black 96-well microplates (Cat #42-000-0117, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.). To each well, 5 uL of compound (in 4% DMSO) were mixed with 2 uL of 3.5 nM CSF-1R, 25 mM MgCl2 in assay buffer (100 mM HEPES (hydroxyethylpiperazineethylsodiumsulfonate), pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT (dithiothreitol), 0.01% Tween-20), and 2 uL of 1540 uM peptide in assay buffer. The kinase reaction was initiated by adding 1 Î¼L of 10 mM ATP in assay buffer. The final concentrations in the 10 uL reaction mixture were 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% Tween-20, 2% DMSO, 308 uM SYEGNSYTFIDPTQ, 1 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.7 nM CSF-1R.

The assay was performed in black 96-well microplates (Cat #42-000-0117, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.). To each well, 5 uL of compound (in 4% DMSO) were mixed with 2 uL of 3.5 nM CSF-1R, 25 mM MgCl2 in assay buffer (100 mM HEPES (hydroxyethylpiperazineethylsodiumsulfonate), pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT (dithiothreitol), 0.01% Tween-20), and 2 uL of 1540 uM peptide in assay buffer. The kinase reaction was initiated by adding 1 Î¼L of 10 mM ATP in assay buffer. The final concentrations in the 10 uL reaction mixture were 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% Tween-20, 2% DMSO, 308 uM SYEGNSYTFIDPTQ, 1 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.7 nM CSF-1R.

Incubation mixtures contained the following: 50 mM NaHEPES, pH 7.3, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM MnCl2, 0.01% Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT, 1% DMSO, 10 uM ATP, 25 nM LANCE Ultra ULight-poly GAT and 0.5 nM cFMS in a total volume of 10 uL. The concentration of compounds of Formula I was varied over 10-point, 3-fold dilution series with 10,000 nM typically being the highest dose. Incubations were carried out in white ProxyPlate-384 Plus plates (PerkinElmer) at 22 C. for 20 minutes, after which 10 uL of a quench/detection solution was added containing 1x LANCE Detection Buffer, 2 nM LANCE EuW1024 Anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20) and 36 mM EDTA.

The assay was performed in black 96-well microplates (Cat #42-000-0117, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.). To each well, 5 uL of compound (in 4% DMSO) were mixed with 2 uL of 3.5 nM CSF-1R, 25 mM MgCl2 in assay buffer (100 mM HEPES (hydroxyethylpiperazineethylsodiumsulfonate), pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT (dithiothreitol), 0.01% Tween-20), and 2 uL of 1540 uM peptide in assay buffer. The kinase reaction was initiated by adding 1 Î¼L of 10 mM ATP in assay buffer. The final concentrations in the 10 uL reaction mixture were 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% Tween-20, 2% DMSO, 308 uM SYEGNSYTFIDPTQ, 1 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.7 nM CSF-1R. Positive and negative control wells were included on each plate, where 4% DMSO in assay buffer was substituted for the compound; in addition, positive control wells received 1.2 uL of 50 mM EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) before the start of the reaction."

The assay was performed in black 96-well microplates (Cat #42-000-0117, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.). To each well, 5 uL of compound (in 4% DMSO) were mixed with 2 uL of 3.5 nM CSF-1R, 25 mM MgCl2 in assay buffer (100 mM HEPES (hydroxyethylpiperazineethylsodiumsulfonate), pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT (dithiothreitol), 0.01% Tween-20), and 2 uL of 1540 uM peptide in assay buffer. The kinase reaction was initiated by adding 1 Î¼L of 10 mM ATP in assay buffer. The final concentrations in the 10 uL reaction mixture were 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% Tween-20, 2% DMSO, 308 uM SYEGNSYTFIDPTQ, 1 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.7 nM CSF-1R. Positive and negative control wells were included on each plate, where 4% DMSO in assay buffer was substituted for the compound; in addition, positive control wells received 1.2 uL of 50 mM EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) before the start of the reaction."

The assay was performed in black 96-well microplates (Cat #42-000-0117, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.). To each well, 5 uL of compound (in 4% DMSO) were mixed with 2 uL of 3.5 nM CSF-1R, 25 mM MgCl2 in assay buffer (100 mM HEPES (hydroxyethylpiperazineethylsodiumsulfonate), pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT (dithiothreitol), 0.01% Tween-20), and 2 uL of 1540 uM peptide in assay buffer. The kinase reaction was initiated by adding 1 Î¼L of 10 mM ATP in assay buffer. The final concentrations in the 10 uL reaction mixture were 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% Tween-20, 2% DMSO, 308 uM SYEGNSYTFIDPTQ, 1 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.7 nM CSF-1R. Positive and negative control wells were included on each plate, where 4% DMSO in assay buffer was substituted for the compound; in addition, positive control wells received 1.2 uL of 50 mM EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) before the start of the reaction."

The assay was performed in black 96-well microplates (Cat #42-000-0117, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.). To each well, 5 uL of compound (in 4% DMSO) were mixed with 2 uL of 3.5 nM CSF-1R, 25 mM MgCl2 in assay buffer (100 mM HEPES (hydroxyethylpiperazineethylsodiumsulfonate), pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT (dithiothreitol), 0.01% Tween-20), and 2 uL of 1540 uM peptide in assay buffer. The kinase reaction was initiated by adding 1 Î¼L of 10 mM ATP in assay buffer. The final concentrations in the 10 uL reaction mixture were 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% Tween-20, 2% DMSO, 308 uM SYEGNSYTFIDPTQ, 1 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.7 nM CSF-1R. Positive and negative control wells were included on each plate, where 4% DMSO in assay buffer was substituted for the compound; in addition, positive control wells received 1.2 uL of 50 mM EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) before the start of the reaction."
