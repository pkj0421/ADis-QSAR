Mink lung epithelial cells CCL64 (named as x9CAGA/CCL64 cells) stably incorporating this reporter plasmid were established. The x9CAGA/CCL64 cells were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS, penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 g/ml), and blasticidin S (1 ug/ml). The x9CAGA/CCL64 cells were seeded in a 96 well plate at a concentration of 10000 cells/well, and cultured in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37C.

The x9CAGA/CCL64 cells were seeded in a 96 well plate at a concentration of 10000 cells/well, and cultured in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37C.

The x9CAGA/CCL64 cells were seeded in a 96 well plate at a concentration of 10000 cells/well, and cultured in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37C.

The x9CAGA/CCL64 cells were seeded in a 96 well plate at a concentration of 10000 cells/well, and cultured in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37C.

Mink lung epithelial cells CCL64 (named as x9CAGA/CCL64 cells) stably incorporating this reporter plasmid were established. The x9CAGA/CCL64 cells were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS, penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 g/ml), and blasticidin S (1 ug/ml). The x9CAGA/CCL64 cells were seeded in a 96 well plate at a concentration of 10000 cells/well, and cultured in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37C.

The x9CAGA/CCL64 cells were seeded in a 96 well plate at a concentration of 10000 cells/well, and cultured in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37C.

That is, a reporter plasmid having a DNA sequence (CAGA sequence), which is activated by binding to Smad3/Smad4 complex, is linked to the upstream of the luciferase gene (luminescence enzyme) was prepared. Mink lung epithelial cells CCL64 (named as x9CAGA/CCL64 cells) stably incorporating this reporter plasmid were established. The x9CAGA/CCL64 cells were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS, penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 g/ml), and blasticidin S (1 ug/ml). The x9CAGA/CCL64 cells were seeded in a 96 well plate at a concentration of 10000 cells/well, and cultured in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37C.

The x9CAGA/CCL64 cells were seeded in a 96 well plate at a concentration of 10000 cells/well, and cultured in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37C.
