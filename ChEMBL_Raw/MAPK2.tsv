The inhibitor concentration is varied between 0.02-30,000 nM, while the Hsp27 peptide substrate and MgATP are held constant at 1 μM and 10 μM, respectively. Activated p38α is added to a final concentration of 20 pM for reactions with nonphosphorylated 1 nM His6-MK2 in the cascade reaction. For the p38α/PRAK cascade, unactivated GST-PRAK is held constant at 1 nM while p38α is added in to a final concentration of 20 pM. Kinase reactions are incubated at room temperature and quenched after 30 minutes by the addition of stop buffer (180 mM HEPES, 30 mM EDTA, and 0.2% Coating Reagent-3). Under these conditions, approximately 20% of the substrate Hsp27 peptide is phosphorylated. Reactions are initiated by the addition of activated p38α except for preincubation experiments, where reactions are initiated by the addition of Hsp27 peptide and MgATP. Preincubation of p38α with inhibitor or p38α with unactivated His6-MK2 or unactivated GST-PRAK and inhibitor are performed at 2X final assay concentrations at room temperature 240 minutes prior to adding ATP and Hsp27 peptide to initiate catalysis."

The inhibitor concentration is varied between 0.02-30,000 nM, while the Hsp27 peptide substrate and MgATP are held constant at 1 μM and 10 μM, respectively. Activated p38α is added to a final concentration of 20 pM for reactions with nonphosphorylated 1 nM His6-MK2 in the cascade reaction. For the p38α/PRAK cascade, unactivated GST-PRAK is held constant at 1 nM while p38α is added in to a final concentration of 20 pM. Kinase reactions are incubated at room temperature and quenched after 30 minutes by the addition of stop buffer (180 mM HEPES, 30 mM EDTA, and 0.2% Coating Reagent-3). Under these conditions, approximately 20% of the substrate Hsp27 peptide is phosphorylated. Reactions are initiated by the addition of activated p38α except for preincubation experiments, where reactions are initiated by the addition of Hsp27 peptide and MgATP. Preincubation of p38α with inhibitor or p38α with unactivated His6-MK2 or unactivated GST-PRAK and inhibitor are performed at 2X final assay concentrations at room temperature 240 minutes prior to adding ATP and Hsp27 peptide to initiate catalysis."

The kinase activity of p38alpha is determined by its ability to phosphorylate GST-MK2 or GST-PRAK. Activation of MK2 or PRAK by p38alpha is quantitated by measuring the phosphorylation of a fluorescently-labeled, MK2/PRAK specific peptide substrate, Hsp27 peptide (FITC-KKKALSRQLSVAA). The phosphorylation of the Hsp27 peptide is quantified using IMAP technology (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale Calif.). Kinase reactions are carried out in a 384-well plate (Greiner, 781280) in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Triton X-100, 0.01% BSA, 1 mM DTT, and 2% DMSO. The inhibitor concentration is varied between 0.02-30,000 nM, while the Hsp27 peptide substrate and MgATP are held constant at 1 uM and 10 uM, respectively. Activated p38alpha is added to a final concentration of 30 uM for reactions with nonphosphorylated 1 nM GST-MK2."

The inhibitor concentration is varied between 0.02-30,000 nM, while the Hsp27 peptide substrate and MgATP are held constant at 1 μM and 10 μM, respectively. Activated p38α is added to a final concentration of 20 pM for reactions with nonphosphorylated 1 nM His6-MK2 in the cascade reaction. For the p38α/PRAK cascade, unactivated GST-PRAK is held constant at 1 nM while p38α is added in to a final concentration of 20 pM. Kinase reactions are incubated at room temperature and quenched after 30 minutes by the addition of stop buffer (180 mM HEPES, 30 mM EDTA, and 0.2% Coating Reagent-3). Under these conditions, approximately 20% of the substrate Hsp27 peptide is phosphorylated. Reactions are initiated by the addition of activated p38α except for preincubation experiments, where reactions are initiated by the addition of Hsp27 peptide and MgATP. Preincubation of p38α with inhibitor or p38α with unactivated His6-MK2 or unactivated GST-PRAK and inhibitor are performed at 2X final assay concentrations at room temperature 240 minutes prior to adding ATP and Hsp27 peptide to initiate catalysis."

The inhibitor concentration is varied between 0.02-30,000 nM, while the Hsp27 peptide substrate and MgATP are held constant at 1 μM and 10 μM, respectively. Activated p38α is added to a final concentration of 20 pM for reactions with nonphosphorylated 1 nM His6-MK2 in the cascade reaction. For the p38α/PRAK cascade, unactivated GST-PRAK is held constant at 1 nM while p38α is added in to a final concentration of 20 pM. Kinase reactions are incubated at room temperature and quenched after 30 minutes by the addition of stop buffer (180 mM HEPES, 30 mM EDTA, and 0.2% Coating Reagent-3). Under these conditions, approximately 20% of the substrate Hsp27 peptide is phosphorylated. Reactions are initiated by the addition of activated p38α except for preincubation experiments, where reactions are initiated by the addition of Hsp27 peptide and MgATP. Preincubation of p38α with inhibitor or p38α with unactivated His6-MK2 or unactivated GST-PRAK and inhibitor are performed at 2X final assay concentrations at room temperature 240 minutes prior to adding ATP and Hsp27 peptide to initiate catalysis."

Compounds: The final test concentration of the compound was 10 μM at maximum. Firstly, a 50-fold concentration (i.e. 500 μM) was prepared with 100% DMSO. The compound was diluted with 100% DMSO by 5 folds at 5 concentrations (successively 500 μM, 100 μM, 20 μM, 4 μM, and 0.8 μM). After diluting with 1-fold kinase buffer by 10 folds, 5 μl of the samples were transferred to a 384-well reaction plate. Two negative control wells and two positive control wells were set at each line respectively. Replication was made in a 96-well plate in five concentrations of 5-fold compound. 10% DMSO was added to the positive control well, and 5 μl of EDTA (250 mM) was added to the negative control well. Procedure: To the 384-well reaction plate was added 5-fold compound dissolved in 10% DMSO at 5 μl/well. To the 384-well reaction plate was added 2.5-fold kinase solution at 10 Î¼l/well. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 10 mins. To the 384-well reaction plate was added 2.5-fold substrate solution at 10 μl/well. The plate was incubated at 28° C. for a certain period. 25 μl termination solution was added to terminate the reaction."

The inhibitor concentration is varied between 0.02-30,000 nM, while the Hsp27 peptide substrate and MgATP are held constant at 1 μM and 10 μM, respectively. Activated p38α is added to a final concentration of 20 pM for reactions with nonphosphorylated 1 nM His6-MK2 in the cascade reaction. For the p38α/PRAK cascade, unactivated GST-PRAK is held constant at 1 nM while p38α is added in to a final concentration of 20 pM. Kinase reactions are incubated at room temperature and quenched after 30 minutes by the addition of stop buffer (180 mM HEPES, 30 mM EDTA, and 0.2% Coating Reagent-3). Under these conditions, approximately 20% of the substrate Hsp27 peptide is phosphorylated. Reactions are initiated by the addition of activated p38α except for preincubation experiments, where reactions are initiated by the addition of Hsp27 peptide and MgATP. Preincubation of p38α with inhibitor or p38α with unactivated His6-MK2 or unactivated GST-PRAK and inhibitor are performed at 2X final assay concentrations at room temperature 240 minutes prior to adding ATP and Hsp27 peptide to initiate catalysis."

The inhibitor concentration is varied between 0.02-30,000 nM, while the Hsp27 peptide substrate and MgATP are held constant at 1 μM and 10 μM, respectively. Activated p38α is added to a final concentration of 20 pM for reactions with nonphosphorylated 1 nM His6-MK2 in the cascade reaction. For the p38α/PRAK cascade, unactivated GST-PRAK is held constant at 1 nM while p38α is added in to a final concentration of 20 pM. Kinase reactions are incubated at room temperature and quenched after 30 minutes by the addition of stop buffer (180 mM HEPES, 30 mM EDTA, and 0.2% Coating Reagent-3). Under these conditions, approximately 20% of the substrate Hsp27 peptide is phosphorylated. Reactions are initiated by the addition of activated p38α except for preincubation experiments, where reactions are initiated by the addition of Hsp27 peptide and MgATP. Preincubation of p38α with inhibitor or p38α with unactivated His6-MK2 or unactivated GST-PRAK and inhibitor are performed at 2X final assay concentrations at room temperature 240 minutes prior to adding ATP and Hsp27 peptide to initiate catalysis."
